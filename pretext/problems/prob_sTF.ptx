True or false?

<li>
<m>\vnabla\cdot(\va \times\vr) = 0</m>, where <m>\va</m> is a constant vector in
<m>\bbbr^3</m> , and <m>\vr</m> is the vector field <m>\vr= (x, y, z)</m>.
</li>

<m>\vnabla\cdot(f \vF) = \vnabla(f)\cdot \vF + f \vnabla\cdot\vF</m>,
for every vector field <m>\vF</m> in <m>\bbbr^3</m> with continuous partial derivatives,
and every scalar function <m>f</m> in <m>\bbbr^3</m> with continuous partial
derivatives.
</li>
<li>
Suppose <m>\vF</m> is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives
in the region <m>D</m>, where <m>D</m> is <m>\bbbr^3</m> without the origin.
If <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF   \gt  0</m> throughout <m>D</m>, then the flux of <m>F</m>
through the sphere of radius <m>5</m> with center at the origin is positive.
</li>
<li>
If a vector field <m>\vF</m> is defined and has continuous partial
derivatives everywhere in <m>\bbbr^3</m>, and it satisfies <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF = 0</m>, everywhere, then, for every sphere, the flux out of one hemisphere is equal
to the flux into the opposite hemisphere.

<li>
If <m>\vr(t)</m> is a twice continuously differentiable path in <m>\bbbr^2</m>

<li>
If a vector field <m>\vF = (P, Q)</m> in <m>\bbbr^2</m> has <m>Q = 0</m> everywhere in

<answer><p>
(a) True</p><p>
(b) True</p><p>
(c) True</p><p>

<p>(e) True
</p>

<p>(f) That depends. If <m>\ka=0</m>, the curve is part of a straight

</p>

<p>(g) False.</p><p>
(h) False.</p><p>
(i) False.
</p></answer>

<solution><p> (a) True.
For any constant vector <m>\va=(a_1,a_2,a_3)</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
\va\times\vr
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}
\hi &amp;\hj &amp;\hk
</mrow><mrow>
a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3
</mrow><mrow>

\right]
= (a_2 z - a_3 y)\hi
 -(a_1 z - a_3 x)\hj
 +(a_1 y - a_2 x)\hj
</mrow>
</md>
This vector field does indeed have divergence <m>0</m>.
</p>

<p>  (b) True. This is our conservative field screening condition
Theorem <xref ref="thm_degTwoIdentities"/>.b.
</p>

<p>  (c) True. This is one of our vector identities, namely
Theorem <xref ref="thm_divIdentities"/>.c.
</p>

<p>  (d) False. The trap here is that <m>\vF</m> need not be defined
at the origin. We saw, in Example <xref ref="eg_fluxIntegralA"/>, that the point source <m>\vF_S=\frac{m\vr}{|\vr|^3}</m> had flux
<m>4\pi m</m> through every sphere centred on the  origin. We also saw,
in Example <xref ref="eg_divThmD"/>, that the divergence
<m>\vnabla\cdot\vF_S=0</m> everywhere except at the origin (where it is not defined).
So if we choose <m>m</m> to be a very big negative number (say <m>-10^{100}</m>)
and add in a very small vector field with positive divergence
(say <m> 10^{-100}(x\hi+y\hj +z\hk)</m>), we will get the vector field
<m>\vF = -10^{100}\frac{\vr}{|\vr|^3} + 10^{-100}(x\hi+y\hj +z\hk)</m>
which has divergence <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=3\times 10^{-100} \gt 0</m> everywhere
except at the origin. The flux of this field through the specified sphere will
be <m>-4\pi\times 10^{100}</m> plus a very small positive number.
</p>

<p>  (e) True. The statement that
 <q>the flux out of one hemisphere is equal
   to the flux into the opposite hemisphere</q>
is equivalent to the statement that
  <q>the flux out of the sphere is equal to zero</q>.
Since <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=0</m> everywhere, that is true by the divergence
theorem.
</p>

<p>  (f) That depends.
</p>

<p>If <m>\ka=0</m>, then <m>\diff{\hat\vT}{s}=0</m>, so that <m>\diff{\vr}{s}=\hat\vT</m>
is a constant. So <m>\vr(s) = s\hat\vT +\vr(0)</m> is part of a straight line.
</p>

<p>If <m>\ka \gt 0</m>, then, because the curve is in a plane, the torsion <m>\tau</m> is
zero and the Frenet-Serret formulae reduce to
<me>
\diff{\hat\vT}{s} = \ka\hat\vN\qquad
\diff{\hat\vN}{s} = -\ka\hat\vT
</me>
Now consider the centre of curvature <m>\vc(s) = \vr(s) +\frac{1}{\ka}\hat\vN(s)</m>.
Since
<me>
\diff{\vc}{s} = \diff{\vr}{s} +\frac{1}{\ka}\diff{\hat\vN}{s}
              =\hat\vT(s) +\frac{1}{\ka}\big(-\ka\hat\vT(s)\big)
              =\vZero
</me>
<m>\vc(s)</m> is a constant and
<me>
|\vr(s) -\vc| =\frac{1}{\ka}
</me>
which says that the curve is part of the circle of radius <m>\frac{1}{\ka}</m>
centred on <m>\vc</m>.
</p>

<p>  (g) False. We saw in Examples
<xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/> and
<xref ref="eg_greenCC"/> that the given vector
field is not conservative.
</p>

<p>  (h) False. For example, if <m>P=-y</m>, then
<m>\oint_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}=-\oint_C y\,\dee{x}</m>
is the area inside <m>C</m>. See Corollary <xref ref="cor_greens"/>.
</p>

<p>  (i) False.
</p>

<p>If <m>\diff{\vv}{t}=\va</m> is a constant, then
<m>\vv(t) =\va\, t+\vv_0</m>. Integrating a second time,
<m>\vr(t) = \frac{1}{2}\va\,t^2 +\vv_0\, t+\vr_0</m>. This is not a spiral,
whether or not the speed is constant. (In fact, for the speed <m>|\vv(t)|
=|\va\, t+\vv_0|</m> to be constant, <m>\va</m> has to be <m>\vZero</m>,
so that <m>\vr(t) = \vv_0\, t+\vr_0</m> is a straight line.)
</p>

<p>Another way to come to the same conclusion uses
<me>
\va(t)=\difftwo{s}{t}(t)\,\hat\vT(t)
                             +\ka(t)\Big(\diff{s}{t}(t)\Big)^2\hat\vN(t)
</me>
As the speed <m>\diff{s}{t}</m> is a constant, it reduces to
<me>
\va(t)=\ka(t)\Big(\diff{s}{t}(t)\Big)^2\hat\vN(t)
</me>
As <m>\va(t)</m> is a constant, its direction, <m>\hat\vN(t)</m>, is also
a constant. The normal vector to a spiral is not constant.

<li>
If a vector field <m>\vF</m> is defined and has continuous partial

False.
For any constant vector <m>\va=(a_1,a_2,a_3)</m>,

is nonzero, unless the constant vector <m>\va=\vZero</m>.
</p>

<p>  (b)
False. For example, if <m>f(x) = x^2</m>, then
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\cdot(\vnabla f)
=\vnabla\cdot(\vnabla x^2)
=\vnabla\cdot(2x\hi)
=2
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>  (c)
False. For example, if <m>\vF = x^2\hi</m>, then
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla(\vnabla\cdot\vF)
=\vnabla\big(\vnabla\cdot(x^2\hi)\big)
=\vnabla(2x)
=2\hi
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>  (d)
False. The trap here is that <m>\vF</m> need not be defined
at the origin. We saw, in Example <xref ref="eg_fluxIntegralA"/>, that the point source <m>\vF=\frac{m\vr}{|\vr|^3}</m> had flux
<m>4\pi m</m> through every sphere centred on the  origin. We also saw,
in Example <xref ref="eg_divThmD"/>, that the divergence
<m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=0</m> everywhere except at the origin (where it is not defined).
</p>

<p>  (e)
True. Any simple, smooth, closed curve in <m>\bbbr^3</m> that avoids the origin
is the boundary of a surface <m>S</m> that also avoids the origin. Then,
by Stokes' theorem,
<me>
\oint_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
=0
</me>
</p>

<p>  (f)
True. Let <m>S=\Set{\vr}{|\vr-\vc|=R}</m> be a sphere.
Denote by <m>V=\Set{\vr}{|\vr-\vc|\le R}</m> the ball whose boundary is <m>S</m>.
Let <m>H</m> be one hemisphere of <m>S</m> with outward pointing normal and let
<m>H'</m> be the other hemisphere of <m>S</m> with inward
point normal. Then the boundary of <m>V</m>, with outward pointing normal,
can be viewed as consisting of two parts, namely <m>H</m> and <m>-H'</m>,
where by <m>-H'</m> we mean <m>H'</m> but with outward pointing normal.
Then, by the divergence theorem
<md>
<mrow>
\dblInt_H \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S} -
\dblInt_{H'} \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
&amp;=\dblInt_{\partial V} \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\tripInt_V \vnabla\cdot\vF\,\dee{V} \gt 0
</mrow>
</md>
which implies that <m>\dblInt_H \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}  \gt
\dblInt_{H'} \vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}</m>.
</p>

<p>  (g)
False. The trap here is that the curve is in <m>\bbbr^3</m>, not <m>\bbbr^2</m>.
As we saw in Example <xref ref="eg_helixTwist"/>,
a helix has constant curvature, but does not lie in a plane and so
is not part of a circle.
</p>

<p>  (h)
False. Even if we restrict <m>\vF</m> to the <m>xy</m>-plane (i.e. to <m>z=0</m>),
this vector field is not conservative. We saw that in Examples
<xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/> and
<xref ref="eg_greenCC"/>.
</p>

<p>  (i)
False. For example, the vector field <m>\vF = x\,\hk</m> is always parallel to the
<m>z</m>-axis. So its flow lines are also all parallel to the <m>z</m>-axis.
But if the closed curve <m>C</m> consists of the line segments
<ul>
<li>
<m>L_1</m> from <m>(0,0,0)</m> to <m>(1,0,0)</m>, followed by
</li>

</ul>
then
<ul>
<li>
<m>\int_{L_1} \vF\cdot\dee{\vr} = \int_0^1 (x\hk)\cdot\hi\,\dee{x} = 0</m>
since <m>\hk\perp\hi</m>, <m>\dee{\vr}=\hi\,\dee{x}</m> on <m>L_1</m> and

<m>\int_{L_2} \vF\cdot\dee{\vr} = \int_0^1 (1\hk)\cdot\hk\,\dee{z} = 1</m>

True or false? If <m>\vr(t)</m> is the position at time <m>t</m> of an object moving

</li>
</ol>
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
Beware that in part (f) a surface is defined to be closed if and only if it is
the boundary of a solid region <m>E</m>. Even though that is not the usual
definition, it is be used in this question.

(a) False.</p><p>

(c) True.</p><p>
(d) False.</p><p>
(e) False.</p><p>
(f) True.
</p>

</answer>

<solution><p> (a)
False. <m>\vr''(t)</m> is the full acceleration. So <m>|\vr''(t)|</m>
is the magnitude of the full acceleration, not just the tangential
component of acceleration. For example, if <m>\vr(t) =\cos t\,\hi+\sin t\,\hj</m>
(i.e. the particle is just going around in circles), the
acceleration <m>\vr''(t) = -\cos t\,\hi-\sin t\,\hj</m> is perpendicular
to the direction of motion. So the tangential component of acceleration
is zero, while <m>|\vr''(t)|=1</m>.
</p>

<p>  (b) <m>\hat\vT(t)</m> is the tangent vector to the curve at <m>\vr(t)</m>.
<m>\hat\vN(t)</m> and <m>\hat\vB(t)</m> are both perpendicular to <m>\hat\vT(t)</m>
(and to each other) and so span the plane normal to the curve at <m>\vr(t)</m>.
</p>

<p>  (c) True.
This is (half of) Theorem  <xref ref="thm_screenConserv"/>.
</p>

<p>  (d) False. The statement <m>\vnabla\times(\vnabla\cdot F) = 0</m>
is just plain gibberish, because <m>\vnabla\cdot F</m> is a scalar valued function
and there is no such thing as the curl of a scalar valued function.
</p>

<p>  (e) False. For example if <m>\vF=\hi</m>, then, by the divergence theorem,
<me>
\dblInt_S \vF \cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
 =\tripInt_V\vnabla\cdot\vF\,\dee{V}=0
</me>
Here <m>V=\Set{x,y,z}{x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1}</m> is the inside of the sphere.
</p>

<p>  (f) True. If <m>S</m> is the boundary of the solid region <m>E</m>, then
we can orient <m>S</m> by always choosing the normal vector that points into <m>E</m>.

</answer>

<solution><p>  (a) The helix is approximately a bunch of circles
stacked one on top of each other. The radius of the circles increase
as <m>z</m> increases. So the curvature <em>decreases</em> as <m>z</m> increases.
</p>

<p>  (b) Here are two arguments both of which conclude that <m>f(x)</m>
is <m>D</m>.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> If <m>C</m> were the graph <m>y=f(x)</m>, then <m>f'(x)</m> would
have two points of discontinuity. The curvature <m>\ka(x)</m> would not the
defined at those two points. The function whose graph is <m>D</m> is defined
everywhere and so cannot be the curvature of the function whose graph is <m>C</m>.
</li>
<li> The function whose graph is <m>D</m> has two inflection points.
So its curvature is zero at two points. The function whose graph is <m>C</m>
is indeed zero at two points (that in fact correspond to the inflection points
of <m>D</m>). So <m>D</m> is the graph of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>C</m> is the graph of <m>\kappa(x)</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>  (c) For any fixed <m>y</m>, <m>x^2+z^2=1</m> is a circle of radius <m>1</m>.
So we can parametrize it by <m>x(\theta)=\cos\theta</m>,
<m>z(\theta)=\sin\theta</m>, <m>0\le\theta \lt 2\pi</m>. The <m>y</m>-coordinate of any point on
the intersection is determined by <m>y=xz</m>. So we can use
<me>
\vr(\theta) = \cos\theta\,\hi +\sin\theta\,\hk + \sin\theta\,\cos\theta\,\hj
\qquad 0\le\theta \lt 2\pi
</me>
</p>

<p>  (d)
We are told that the helical ramp starts starts with the <m>y</m>-axis when
<m>z=0</m>.
<ul>
<li>
In the cases of parametrisations (a) and (c),
<m>z=0</m> forces <m>u=0</m> and <m>u=0</m> forces <m>x=y=0</m>. That is only the
origin, not the <m>y</m>-axis. So we can rule out (a) and(c).
</li>
<li>
In the case of parametrisation (b),
<m>z=0</m> forces <m>v=0</m> and <m>v=0</m> forces <m>y=0</m> and <m>x=u</m>. As <m>u</m> varies
that sweeps out the <m>x</m>-axis, not the <m>y</m>-axis.
So we can rule out (b).
</li>
<li>
In the case of parametrisation (d),
<m>z=0</m> forces <m>v=0</m> and <m>v=0</m> forces <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=u</m>. As <m>u</m> varies
that sweeps out the <m>y</m>-axis, which is what we want.
</li>
</ul>
Furthermore
<ul>
<li>
we are told that <m>z=v</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>5</m> and that
</li>
<li>
<m>x^2+y^2=u^2\ge 4</m>
</li>
</ul>
So we want parametrisation (d) with domain <m>|u|\ge 2</m>, <m>0\le v\le 5</m>.
</p>

<p>  (e)
Straight lines have curvature <m>0</m>. So one acceptable
parametrized curve is <m>\vr(t) = t\,\hi</m>, <m>0\le t\le 1</m>.
</p>

<p>  (f)
The cube <m>S</m> has six sides. So the outward flux through

<p>  (h)
By the definition of arclength parametrisation, the arclength along the
curve between <m>\vr(0)</m> and <m>\vr(s)</m> is <m>s</m>. In particular, the
arclength between <m>\vr(0)</m> and <m>\vr(3)</m> is <m>3</m> and the
arclength between <m>\vr(0)</m> and <m>\vr(5)</m>, which is the same as the
arclength between <m>\vr(0)</m> and <m>\vr(3)</m> plus the
arclength between <m>\vr(3)</m> and <m>\vr(5)</m>,
is <m>5</m>. So the arclength between <m>\vr(3)</m> and <m>\vr(5)</m> is <m>5-3=2</m>.
</p>

<p>  (i)
In this solution, we'll use, for example <m>-T</m> to refer to the curve
<m>T</m>, but with the arrow pointing in the opposite direction to that of
the arrow on <m>T</m>.
</p>

<p>In parts (2), (3) and (4) we will choose <m>\vF</m> to be the vector field
<me>
\vG(x,y) = -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\hi + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\hj
</me>
We saw, in Example <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/>, that <m>\vnabla\times\vG=\vZero</m>
except at the origin where it is not defined.
We also saw, in Example <xref ref="eg_greenCC"/>,
that <m>\oint_{C}\vG\cdot\dee{\vr}=2\pi</m> for any counterclockwise oriented
circle centred on the origin.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1):
Let <m>\cR_1</m> be the region between <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>. It is the shaded region
in the figure on the left below. Note that <m>\cR_1</m> is contained in the
domain of <m>\vF</m>, so that <m>\vnabla\times\vF=\vZero</m> on all of <m>\cR_1</m>.
The boundary of <m>\cR_1</m> is <m>S-T</m>, meaning that the boundary consists
of two parts, with one part being <m>S</m> and the other part being <m>-T</m>.
So, by Stokes' theorem
<me>
\int_S \vF\cdot\dee{\vr} - \int_T \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_{\partial \cR_1} \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_{\cR_1} \vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hk\, \dee{S}
=0

and (1) is true.

</li>
<li> (2): False. Choose a coordinate system so that <m>Q</m> is at the origin
and choose <m>\vF=\vG</m>.
We saw, in Examples <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/> and
<xref ref="eg_greenCC"/>, that the curl of
<m>\vG</m> vanished everywhere except at the origin, where it was not defined,
but that <m>\int_R \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} \ne 0</m>.
</li>
<li><p>
(3),(4): False. Here is a counterxample that shows that both
(3) and (4) are false. Choose a coordinate system so that <m>Q</m> is
at the origin and choose <m>\vF=\vG</m>. By Stokes' theorem
<me>
\int_S \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}
= \int_T \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} = 0
</me>
because <m>\vnabla\times\vG=\vZero</m> everywhere inside <m>S</m>, including at <m>P</m>.
So now both parts (3) and (4) reduce to the claim that
<m>\int_U \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}
= \int_R \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}</m>.
</p>

<p>We saw, in Example <xref ref="eg_greenCC"/>, that  <m>\int_R \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} = 2\pi</m>.
</p>

<p>To finish off the counterexample,
we'll now show that <m>\int_U \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} = -2\pi</m>.
Let <m>\cR_2</m> be the region between <m>U</m> and <m>R</m>. It is the shaded region
in the figure on the right above. Note that <m>\vnabla\times\vG=\vZero</m>
on all of <m>\cR_2</m>. including at <m>P</m>.
The boundary of <m>\cR_2</m> is <m>-U-R</m>, meaning that the boundary consists
of two parts, with one part being <m>-U</m> and the other part being <m>-R</m>.
So, by Stokes' theorem
<me>
-\int_U \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} - \int_R \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_{\partial \cR_2} \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_{\cR_2} \vnabla\times\vG\cdot\hk\, \dee{S}
=0
</me>
and
<m>\int_U \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} =-\int_R \vG\cdot\dee{\vr} = -2\pi</m>
</p>
</li>
<li> (5): False. For any conservative vector field <m>\vF</m>, with potential <m>f</m>,
<m>\int_V \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> is just the difference of the values of <m>f</m> at
the two end points of <m>V</m>. It is easy to choose an <m>f</m> for which those
two values are different. For example <m>f(x,y)=x</m> does the job.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> (j)
Let <m>S</m> be any closed surface and denote by <m>V</m> the
volume that it encloses. Presumably  the question assumes that
<m>S</m> is oriented so that <m>S=\partial V</m>. Then by the divergence
theorem
<me>
\dblInt_S \vF \cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
=\dblInt_{\partial V} \vF \cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
=\tripInt_V \vnabla\cdot\vF\ \dee{V}
</me>
This is exactly the volume of <m>V</m> if <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=1</m>
everywhere. One vector field <m>\vF</m> with <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=1</m>
everywhere is <m>\vF=x\,\hi</m>.
</p>

<p>  (k)
Let <m>\cC</m> be the counterclockwise boundary of a small square centred
on <m>P</m>, like the blue curve in the figure below, but much smaller.
Call the square (the inside of <m>\cC</m>) <m>S</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="54%">
  <image source="pfigs/shearFieldb"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
  By Stokes' theorem
<me>
\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hk\ \dee{S}
=\oint_\cC \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
</me>
<ul>
<li>
The contribution to <m>\oint_\cC \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> coming from the left and
right sides of <m>\cC</m> will be zero, because <m>\vF</m> is perpendicular
to <m>\dee{\vr}</m> there.
</li>
<li>
The contribution to <m>\oint_\cC \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> coming from the
top of <m>\cC</m> will be negative, because there <m>\vF</m> is a positive number times
<m>\hi</m> and <m>\dee{\vr}</m> is a negative number times <m>\hi</m>.
</li>
<li>
The contribution to <m>\oint_\cC \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> coming from the
bottom of <m>\cC</m> will be positive, because there <m>\vF</m> is a positive
number times <m>\hi</m> and <m>\dee{\vr}</m> is a positive number times <m>\hi</m>.
</li>
<li>
The magnitude of the contribution from the top of <m>\cC</m> will be
larger than the magnitude of the contribution from the bottom of <m>\cC</m>,
because <m>|\vF|</m> is larger on the top than on the bottom.
</li>
</ul>
So, all together, <m>\oint_\cC \vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \lt 0</m>, and consequently
(taking a limit as the square size tends to zero)
<m>\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hk</m> is negative at <m>P</m>.

(g) true</p><p>
(h) false</p><p>
(i) false</p><p>
(j) false
</p></answer>

<solution><p> (a) False. We could have, for example,
<m>\vnabla\cdot\vF</m> zero at one point and strictly positive elsewhere.
One example would be <m>\vF = x^3\,\hi+y^3\,\hj +z^3\,\hk</m>, with <m>S_1</m> and

</p>

<p>(b) False. The conditions that (1) <m>\vnabla\times\vF</m> = 0 and (2) the domain of
<m>\vF</m> is simply-connected, are sufficient, but not necessary,
to imply that <m>\vF</m> is conservative. For example the vector field
<m>\vF=\vZero</m>, with any domain at all, is conservative with potential <m>0</m>.
Another example (which does not depend on choosing a domain that is smaller
than the largest possible domain) is <m>\vF=\vnabla\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}</m>
with domain <m>\Set{(x,y,z)}{ (x,y)\ne  (0,0)}</m>. That is, the domain is
<m>\bbbr^3</m> with the <m>z</m>-axis removed.
</p>

<p>(c) That's true. Consider any point <m>\vr(t_0)</m> on a parametrized curve
<m>\vr(t)</m>. That's the blue point in the figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside width="42%">
  <image source="pfigs/circleCentreC"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The centre of curvature for the curve at <m>\vr(t_0)</m> is
<m>\vc = \vr(t_0)+\rho(t_0)\hat\vN(t_0)</m>. It is the red dot in the figure.
<ul>
<li>
The radius of the osculating circle is the distance from its centre,
<m>\vc</m>, to any point of the circle,
like <m>\vr(t_0)</m>. That's <m>|\vr(t_0) -\vc| = |\rho(t_0)\hat\vN(t_0)|
= \rho(t_0)</m>.
The curvature of the osculating circle is one over its radius.
So its curvature is <m>\frac{1}{\rho(t_0)}=\ka(t_0)</m>.
</li>
<li>
The unit normal to the osculating circle at <m>\vr(t_0)</m> is a unit
vector in the opposite direction to the radius vector from the centre
<m>\vc</m> to <m>\vr(t_0)</m>. The radius vector is
<m>\vr(t_0)-\vc_0=-\rho(t_0)\hat\vN(t_0)</m>, so the unit normal is <m>\hat\vN(t_0)</m>.
</li>
<li>
The osculating circle lies in the plane that best fits the curve
near <m>\vr(t_0)</m>. (See the beginning of §<xref ref="sec_Curve3d"/>.) So the unit tangents to the osculating circle
at <m>\vr(t_0)</m> are perpendicular to both <m>\hat\vN(t_0)</m> and
<m>\hat\vB(t_0)</m> and so are either <m>\hat\vT(t_0)</m> or <m>-\hat\vT(t_0)</m>,
depending on how we orient the osculating circle.

<solution><p>
(a) False. Changing the orientation of a surface does not change <m>\dee{S}</m>
at all. (It changes <m>\hn\dee{S}</m> by a factor of <m>(-1)</m>.) So
<me>
\dblInt_S f\, \dee{S} = +\dblInt_{-S} f\,\dee{S}

<p>  (b) False. For every vector field with two continuous

</md>
whether or not <m>\vF</m> is conservative.
</p>

<p>  (c) True. Define the vector field <m>\vF=f\,\hi</m>.
Then, by Stokes' theorem,
<md>
<mrow>
\int_C f\,\dee{x}
=\int_C \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_S\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}

          - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\hk\right)\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>  (d) True.
The left hand side, <m>(\vnabla f ) \times (\vnabla f )</m>, is zero
because <m>(\vnabla f )</m> is parallel to itself and the right hand side
<m>\vnabla  \times (\vnabla f )</m> is zero by

<p>  (e) True. The curve

is a straight line. Straight lines have curvature <m>0</m>.
</p>

<p>  (f) True. In general <m>|\vr'(t)|=\diff{s}{t}</m>. Under arc
length parametrization <m>t=s</m> so that <m>\diff{s}{t}=1</m>.

(e) <m>\int_{\cC_2}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \lt 0</m></p><p>
(f) <m>\vF</m> is not conservative
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
(a) <m>P</m> is the <m>x</m>-component of <m>\vF</m>. As we travel vertically upward
through <m>A</m>, that <m>x</m>-component decreases. Hence <m>P_y \lt 0</m> at <m>A</m>.
</p>

<p>(b) <m>Q</m> is the <m>y</m>-component of <m>\vF</m>. As we travel horizontally to the
right through <m>A</m>, that <m>y</m>-component increases. Hence <m>Q_x \gt 0</m> at <m>A</m>.
</p>

<p>(c) <m>\vnabla\times\vF = (Q_x-P_y)\hk</m> and <m>Q_x-P_y \gt 0</m> at <m>A</m>, so that
the curl of <m>\vF</m> at <m>A</m> is in the direction of <m>+\hk</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) Along the curve <m>\cC_1</m> the magnitude of the angle between <m>\vF</m>
and <m>\dee{\vr}</m> is less than <m>90^\circ</m>, so that <m>\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \gt 0</m>
and <m>\int_{\cC_1}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \gt 0</m>.
</p>

<p>(e) Along the curve <m>\cC_2</m> the magnitude of the angle between <m>\vF</m>
and <m>\dee{\vr}</m> is greater than <m>90^\circ</m>, so that <m>\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \lt 0</m>
and <m>\int_{\cC_2}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} \lt 0</m>.
</p>

<p>(f) If <m>\vF</m> were conservative, we would have <m>\int_{\cC_1}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_{\cC_2}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m>. As these two integrals have opposite signs
<m>\vF</m> is not conservative. (Since <m>\vF</m> is not conservative, it is not the gradient of some function. At <m>A</m>, <m>P_x \gt 0</m> and <m>Q_y \gt 0</m>. So <m>\vF</m> is not divergence free and is not the curl of a vector potential.)

<hint><p>
Read all of the statements very carefully. The details are critical.
</p>

<p>(a) The integral <m>\int_C f\,\dee{s}=0</m> is not of the form
     <m>\int_C \vF \cdot \dee{\vr}</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) <m>\vF</m> and <m>\vG</m> can be any vector fields.
</p>

<p>(e) Think about how <m>\int_C f\,\dee{s}</m> is defined.
</p>

<p>(f) Look at <m>\frac{\partial\vr}{\partial u}\times
          \frac{\partial\vr}{\partial u}</m> <em>very</em> closely.
</p>

<p>(g) The integral is completely independent of <m>x(u,v)</m> and <m>y(u,v)</m>.

(a) False.</p><p>
(b) False.</p><p>
(c) True.</p><p>
(d) False.</p><p>
(e) True.</p><p>
(f) False.
</p>

<p>(g) False.</p><p>
(h) True.</p><p>
(i) False.
</p>

</answer>

<solution><p>
(a) False. <m>\vnabla f=\vZero</m> if and only if <m>f</m> is constant. But
if <m>f</m> is the constant <m>K</m>, then <m>\int_C f\,\dee{s}</m> is <m>K</m> times the
length of <m>C</m>, which need not be zero.
</p>

<p>(b) False. Any curve which lies in a plane has constant binormal.
For example, the circle <m>\vr(t) =\cos t\,\hi +\sin t\,\hj +0\,\hk</m>
has constant binormal <m>\hat\vB=\hk</m>, but is not a straight line.
</p>

<p>(c) True. If <m>\vr(t)</m> has constant speed, the <m>\big(\diff{s}{t}(t)\big)^2
=\vr'(t)\cdot\vr'(t)</m> is constant and
<md>
<mrow>
0= \diff{ }{t} \big(\vr'(t)\cdot\vr'(t)\big)
= 2\vr'(t)\cdot\vr''(t)
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>(d) False. For the line integral <m>\int_C\big(\vF\times\vG\big)\cdot\dee{\vr}</m>
to be independent of the path <m>C</m>, the vector field <m>\vF\times\vG</m>
has to be conservative and so has to obey <m>\vnabla\times(\vF\times\vG)=\vZero</m>.
But
<ul>
<li>
Not all vector fields are conservative. For example, the vector field
<m>\vH = x\,\hj</m> obeys <m>\vnabla\times\vH = \hk</m> and so is not conservative.
</li>
<li>
We can make <m>\vF\times\vG</m> be <em>any</em> vector field through judicious
choices of <m>\vF</m> and <m>\vG</m>. For example, if <m>\vF= x\,\hk</m> and <m>\vG = \hi</m>,
then <m>\vF\times\vG=x\,\hk\times\hi=x\,\hj=\vH</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>(e) True. The contribution to <m>\int_C f\,\dee{s}</m> from an
<q>infinitesmal piece of <m>C</m></q> is the value of <m>f</m> on the piece
times the <em>length</em> of the piece. That does not depend on the
orientation of the piece.
</p>

<p>(f) False. The two vectors in the cross product
<m>\frac{\partial\vr}{\partial u}\times \frac{\partial\vr}{\partial u}</m>
are identical. So the cross product is <m>\vZero</m>.
</p>

<p>(g) False. The integral is completely independent of <m>x(u,v)</m> and <m>y(u,v)</m>.
In particular if, for example, <m>x(u,v)= 157u</m>, <m>y(u,v)=157v</m>, <m>z(u,v)=0</m> then
<m>\dblInt_D \left(1+\big(\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u}\big)^2
             +\big(\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v}\big)^2\right)^{1/2}                  \dee{u}\dee{v}</m>
is always exactly the area of <m>D</m>, while the area of <m>S</m> is <m>157^2</m> times the
area of <m>D</m>.
</p>

<p>(h) True. If the fluid is incompressible then its flow preserves volumes
and consequently <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=0</m>.
</p>

<p>(i) Not only False, but Ridiculous. The left had side is  scalar valued
while the right hand side is vector valued.

for some functions <m>g(y,z)</m>, <m>h(z)</m> and constant <m>C</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) False. The curl <m>\vnabla\times\vF</m> is zero for every conservative
vector fields <m>\vF</m>. There are many nonconstant conservative vector fields,
like <m>\vF(x,y,z) = x\,\hi</m>.
</p>

<p>(e) True. As <m>S</m> is closed, it is the boundary of a solid region <m>V</m>.
Then, by the divergence theorem,
<me>
\dblInt_S\vF\cdot\hn\, \dee{S}
=\tripInt_V\vnabla\cdot\vF\,\dee{V}
=0
</me>
</p>

<p>(f) True. If <m>\int_C \vF\cdot \dee{\vr} = 0</m> for every closed curve <m>C</m>,
then <m>\vF</m> is conservative by Theorem  <xref ref="thm_pathIndepConserv"/>.
Consequently, <m>\vnabla \times\vF = 0</m> by Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>.

<p>(g) True. If the speed <m>|\vv|</m> is constant then
<md>
<mrow>
0= \diff{ }{t} |\vv|^2

</md>
Since <m>\hat\vT=\frac{\vv}{|\vv|}</m>, <m>\hat\vT\cdot\va=0</m> too.
Here, we have assumed that the constant <m>|\vv|</m> is not zero.
If the constant <m>|\vv|</m> is zero, then <m>\hat\vT</m> is not defined at all
(and <m>\va=0</m>).
</p>

<p>(h) False. The trap here is that the curve is in <m>\bbbr^3</m>, not <m>\bbbr^2</m>.
As we saw in Example <xref ref="eg_helixTwist"/>,
a helix has constant curvature, but does not lie in a plane and so
is not part of a circle.
</p>

<p>(i) False. The trap here is that we are told nothing about <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF</m>.
As an example, let <m>S_1</m> be the hemisphere
<me>
S_1=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2+z^2=1,\ z\ge 0}
</me>
with upward pointing normal and <m>S_2</m> be the disk

S_2=\Set{(x,y,0)}{x^2+y^2\le 1}

<p>
Set
<me>
V=\Set{(x,y,z)}{0\le z\le \sqrt{x^2+y^2},\ x^2+y^2\le 1}

Then the boundary, <m>\partial V</m>, of <m>V</m> consists of two parts, namely <m>S_1</m>
(with normal pointing upwards) and <m>S_2</m> (but with normal pointing downwards).  The divergence theorem (Theorem <xref ref="thm_divThm"/>)

</mrow>
</md>
If <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF \gt 0</m> (as is the case, for example, if <m>\vF=x\,\hi</m>)
then <m>\dblInt_{S_1} \vF \cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
-\dblInt_{S_2} \vF \cdot \hn\,\dee{S}</m> is definitely nonzero.

<li>
A constant vector field is conservative on <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
</li>
<li>
If <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF= 0</m> for all points in the domain of <m>\vF</m>
then <m>\vF</m> is a constant vector field.

<li>
Let <m>\vr(t)</m>  be a parametrization of a curve <m>C</m> in <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
If <m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\diff{\vr}{t}</m> are orthogonal at all
points of the curve <m>C</m>, then <m>C</m> lies on the surface of a sphere
<m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = a^2</m> for some <m>a \gt 0</m>.
</li>
<li>
The curvature <m>\kappa</m> at a point on a curve depends on the orientation

<li>
The domain of a conservative vector field must be simply connected.

</ol>
</p></statement>

<answer><p>
(a) True</p><p>
(b) False</p><p>
(c) True, assuming that <m>\vr(t)</m> is not indentically <m>\vZero</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) False</p><p>
(e) False
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
(a) True. If the vector field is <m>\vF = a\,\hi +b\,\hj + c\,\hk</m>,
then <m>f(x,y,z) = ax + by + cz</m> obeys <m>\vF=\vnabla f</m> and so
is a potential for <m>\vF</m>.
</p>

<p>(b) False. For example the vector field <m>\vF= x\,\hi-y\,\hj</m>
obeys <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF= 0</m> but is not a constant vector field.
</p>

<p>(c) True, assuming that <m>\vr(t)</m> is not indentically <m>\vZero</m>.
If <m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\diff{\vr}{t}</m> are orthogonal at all
points of the curve <m>C</m>, then
<me>
\diff{ }{t} \big(\vr(t)\cdot\vr(t)\big)
  = 2\vr(t)\cdot\diff{\vr}{t}(t)
  =0
</me>
So <m>x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 + z(t)^2 = \vr(t)\cdot\vr(t)</m> is a constant.
If <m>\vr(t)</m> is not indentically <m>\vZero</m>, that constant must
be strictly positive. That is <m>x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 + z(t)^2 = a^2</m>
for some constant <m>a \gt 0</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) False. The curvature (see §<xref ref="sec_CurveCompendium"/>) is
<me>
\ka(t)= \frac{\Big|\diff{\hat\vT}{t}(t)\Big|}{|\vr'(t)|}
</me>
Changing the orientation of the curve amounts to replacing <m>t</m> by <m>-t</m>.
This changes the signs of <m>\hat\vT</m> and <m>\vr'</m>,
but does not change <m>\ka</m>, because the absolute values eliminate the signs.
</p>

<p>(e) False. For example, the vector field <m>\vF=\vZero</m>, with domain
<m>\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2 \gt 0}</m> is a conservative vector field
(with potential <m>0</m>) whose domain is not simply connected. As a less
nitpicky example, let <m>\vF=\vnabla f</m> with <m>f=\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}</m>. The biggest
possible domain for this vector field is also <m>\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2 \gt 0}</m>.

</p>

<p>(c) In principle, the domain could be any subset of <m>\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2 \gt 0}</m>.
We are not told which subset to use, so, by default, <m>D</m> is the maximal
domain
<me>
D=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2 \gt 0} = \Set{(x,y,z)}{(x,y)\ne (0,0)}
</me>
This <m>D</m> is connected (any two points in <m>D</m>
can be joined by a curve that lies completely in <m>D</m>) but is not
simply connected (the simple closed curve <m>\vr(\theta)=\cos\theta\,\hi

to a point continuously in <m>D</m>). So (I) and (IV) are true. That's (iii).
</p>

<p>(d) False. If the position of the particle at time <m>t</m> is

<solution><p>
(a) True. By the vector identity of Theorem <xref ref="thm_curlIdentities"/>.c,
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\times(f \vnabla f )
=(\vnabla f) \times (\vnabla f)

The second term vanished because of the screening test vector identity
of Theorem <xref ref="thm_degTwoIdentities"/>.b.
</p>

<p>(b) True. That's the vector identity of Theorem <xref ref="thm_divIdentities"/>.c.
</p>

<p>(c) True. To have constant curvature <m>0</m> the curve must have
unit tangent vector <m>\hat\vT(s)</m> obeying
<me>
\diff{\hat\vT}{s}(s)=\vZero
</me>
(See §<xref ref="sec_CurveCompendium"/>.)
So <m>\vr'(s) = \hat\vT(s)</m> must be a constant vector. Call it <m>\hat\vT_0</m>. Integrating gives
<me>
\vr(s) = s\hat\vT_0 +\vr_0
</me>
for some constant vector <m>\vr_0</m>. So <m>\vr(s)</m> lies
on the same straight line for all <m>s</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) False. The trap here is that the curve is in <m>\bbbr^3</m>, not <m>\bbbr^2</m>.
As we saw in Example <xref ref="eg_helixTwist"/>,
a helix has constant curvature, but does not lie in a plane and so
is not part of a circle.
</p>

<p>(e) True. The vector field <m>\vF=\vnabla f</m> is conservative. So, by
Theorem <xref ref="thm_pathIndepConserv"/>.b, the
work integral
<me>
\int_C\vnabla f\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=0
</me>
for any closed curve <m>C</m>, and, in particular, for any circle <m>C</m>.
</p>

<p>(f) True. The statement that
 <q>the flux out of one hemisphere is equal
   to the flux into the opposite hemisphere</q>
is equivalent to the statement that
  <q>the flux out of the sphere is equal to zero</q>.
Since <m>\vnabla\cdot\vF=0</m> everywhere, that is true by the divergence
theorem.
</p>

<p>(g) True. Let <m>S</m> be the boundary of the solid region <m>V</m>.
Then, by the divergence theorem (Theorem <xref ref="thm_divVrn"/>),
<md>
<mrow>
\dblInt_S\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}

</mrow>
</md>
But <m>\vnabla\cdot\big(\vnabla\times\vF\big)</m> is identically zero,
by the screening test vector identity of Theorem <xref ref="thm_degTwoIdentities"/>.a. So the integral
is zero.

<solution><p>
(a) True.
Let <m>\vF</m> be the vector field. We are assuming
that <m>\nabla\times\vF=0</m> on all of <m>\bbbr^3</m>. As a result, <m>\vF=\nabla\phi</m>
for some potential function <m>\phi</m>. We are also assuming that <m>0=\nabla\cdot\vF

of <q><m>\phi</m> is harmonic</q>.
</p>

<p>(b) False.
Let <m>\vF</m> be the vector field. We are assuming
that  <m>\vF=\nabla\phi</m> for some potential function <m>\phi</m>. If <m>S</m> is any
smooth closed surface, with <m>S</m> being the boundary of the solid <m>V</m>, then,
by the divergence theorem, the outward flux of <m>\vF</m> through <m>S</m> is

(d) Yes</p><p>
(d) No
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
(a) <m>\int_C \vnabla f\cdot \dee{\vr}=0</m> is the work done along the
curve using the conservative force <m>\vnabla f</m>. That work is difference
between the potential <m>f</m> at the final point minus the potential <m>f</m>
at the initial point. If the final and initial points are both on the

<p>(b) The rate of change of the specified vector is
<me>
\diff{ }{t} \vv(t)\times\vr(t)

The first term vanishes because <m>\vv'(t)=\va(t)=f(t)\vr(t)</m> is parallel to <m>\vr(t)</m>.
The second term vanishes because <m>\vv(t)=\vv(t)</m>.
</p>

<p>(c) Call the constant vector <m>\vv\times\vr</m> of part (b) <m>\vN</m>.
This vector is a constant
and is perpendicular to both <m>\vv(t)</m> and <m>\vr(t)</m>. In particular

\vN\cdot\vr(t)=0
</me>
Assuming that <m>\vN</m> is nonzero, this is the equation of the plane
through the origin with normal vector <m>\vN</m>.
</p>

<p>(d) Yes, as long as <m>\hat\vT</m>, <m>\hat\vN</m>, and <m>\hat\vB</m> are well-defined,
since <m>\hat\vB = \hat\vT\times\hat\vN</m>.

gives <m>\vv\cdot\va=0</m>, i.e., <m>\vv\perp\va</m> always.  It follows
that <m>|\vv\times\va| = |\vv|\,|\va|\sin\theta = 1</m>
always, because the angle <m>\theta</m> here is always <m>\pi/2</m>.  Thus, for all
<m>t</m>,
<me>
\kappa = { |\vv\times\va|\over |\vv|^3} = {1\over 1} = 1.

<p>(b) <em>True</em><m>\,</m>.
By the divergence theorem, if <m>V</m> is the

\dblInt_{S}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
=\tripInt_V\vnabla\cdot\big(\vnabla\times\vF\big)\ \dee{V}
=0
</me>
since <m>\vnabla\cdot\big(\vnabla\times\vF\big)=0</m>.

<p>(c) <em>False</em><m>\,</m>.
If <m>\vF=0</m> and <m>\vG</m> is any nonzero,
conservative field, like <m>\vG=2x\hi=\vnabla(x^2)</m>, then

<solution><p>
(a)
Define <m>\vOm(t) = \vr(t)\times\vv(t)</m>.  Then by the product rule,
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{\vOm}{t}
&amp;= \diff{\vr}{t}\times\vv + \vr\times\diff{\vv}{t}
\cr
&amp;= \vv\times\vv + \vr\times\big(f(\vr,\vv)\vr\big).
\cr
&amp;= {\bf0} + f(\vr,\vv) \big(\vr\times\vr\big) = {\bf0}.
</mrow>
</md>
It follows that <m>\vOm</m> is constant.
</p>

<p>(b)
By the divergence theorem, where <m>\cR</m> is the solid cylinder as
described,
<me>
\dblInt_\cS(x\,\hi - y\,\hj + z^2\,\hk)\cdot \hn\dee{S}
= \tripInt_\cR\big(1 - 1 + 2z\big)\,\dee{V}
= 2\tripInt_\cR z\,\dee{V}
</me>
The solid <m>\cR</m> clearly has reflection symmetry across the plane <m>z=2</m>.
So the <m>z</m>-coordinate of the centre of mass of <m>\cR</m>,
i.e. the average value of <m>z</m> over <m>\cR</m>,
i.e.
<me>
\bar z =\frac{\tripInt_\cR z\,\dee{V}}{\tripInt_\cR\dee{V}}
=\frac{\tripInt_\cR z\,\dee{V}}{{\rm Vol}(\cR)}
</me>
is <m>2</m>. Hence
<me>
\dblInt_\cS(x\,\hi - y\,\hj + z^2\,\hk)\cdot \hn\dee{S}
= 2\bar z\,{\rm Vol}(\cR)
= 4\,{\rm Vol}(\cR)
</me>
By basic geometry, <m>{\rm Vol}(\cR) = \pi r^2 h = \pi b^2 2</m>.
Hence
<me>
\dblInt_\cS(x\,\hi - y\,\hj + z^2\,\hk)\cdot \hn\dee{S}
= 8\pi b^2
</me>
</p>

<p>(c)
By Stokes' theorem (Theorem <xref ref="thm_Stokes"/>),
<md>
<mrow>
\oint_{\partial D} \vF\cdot \dee{\vr}=\dblInt_D \vG\cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
&amp;\implies \dblInt_D \vnabla\times\vF\cdot \hn\,\dee{S}=\dblInt_D \vG\cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\implies \dblInt_D \big(\vnabla\times\vF-\vG\big)\cdot \hn\,\dee{S}=0
</mrow>
</md>
for all disks <m>D</m>.
Because this is true for all disks <m>D</m>, the integrand  must be zero. To see
this, let <m>\vH=\vnabla\times\vF-\vG</m>. Suppose that <m>\vH(\vx_0)\ne 0</m>.
Pick a unit vector <m>\hn</m> in the direction of <m>\vH(\vx_0)</m>. Let <m>D</m> be a very
small flat disk centered on <m>\vx_0</m> with normal <m>\hn</m> (the vector we picked).
Then <m>\vH(\vx_0)\cdot\hn \gt 0</m> and, by continuity, <m>\vH(\vx)\cdot\hn \gt 0</m> for all
<m>\vx</m> on <m>D</m>, if we have picked <m>D</m> small enough.
 Then <m>\dblInt_D\big(\vnabla\times\vF-\vG\big)\cdot \hn\,\dee{S} \gt 0</m>, which is a
contradiction. So we conclude that
<m>\vnabla\times\vF-\vG=\vZero</m> and hence <m>\vG=\vnabla\times\vF</m>.
