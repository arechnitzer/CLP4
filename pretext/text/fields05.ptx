<title>Optional <mdash/> The Pendulum</title>

<p>Model a pendulum by a mass <m>m</m> that is connected to a hinge by
an idealized rod that is massless and of fixed length <m>\ell</m>. Denote
by <m>\theta</m> the angle

between the rod and vertical. The forces acting on the mass are
<ul>
<li>
gravity, which has magnitude <m>mg</m> and direction <m>(0,-1)</m>,
</li>
<li>
tension in the rod, whose magnitude, <m>\tau</m>, automatically adjusts
itself so that the distance between the mass and the hinge is
fixed at <m>\ell</m> and whose direction,
<m>(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)</m>, is always parallel to the rod and
</li>
<li>
possibly some frictional forces, like friction in the hinge and
air resistance. We shall assume that the total frictional force
has magnitude proportional to the speed<fn>The dependence of air resistance (drag) on the speed <m>v</m> is relatively complex. At low speed drag tends to be approximately proportional to <m>v</m>, while at high speed
it tends to be approximately proportional to <m>v^2</m>.</fn>
of the mass and has direction opposite to the direction of motion of the mass.
</li>
</ul>
If we use a coordinate system centered on the hinge, the <m>(x,y)</m>
coordinates of the mass at time <m>t</m> are
<m>\ell\big(\sin\theta(t),-\cos\theta(t)\big)</m>.
Hence its  velocity vector is
<me>
\vv(t)
 = \diff{\ }{t}\big[\ell\big(\sin\theta(t),-\cos\theta(t)\big) \big]
  = \ell\big(\cos\theta(t),\sin\theta(t)\big)\diff{\theta}{t}(t)
</me>
and the  total frictional force is
<m>-\be \ell(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\diff{\theta}{t}</m>,
for some constant <m>\be</m>.
The acceleration vector of the mass is
<me>
\va(t)=\diff{\ }{t}\vv(t)
=\ell(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\difftwo{\theta}{t}
+\ell(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)\Big(\diff{\theta}{t}\Big)^2
</me>
so that Newton's law of motion, <m>\vF=m\va</m>,  now tells us
<md>
<mrow>
m\va(t) &amp;= m\ell(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\difftwo{\theta}{t}
+m\ell(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)\Big(\diff{\theta}{t}\Big)^2
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\vF=mg(0,-1)+\tau (-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)
-\be \ell(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\diff{\theta}{t}
</mrow>
</md>
To eliminate the (unknown) coefficient <m>\tau</m> we dot this equation with
<m>(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)</m>, which extracts
the component parallel to the direction of motion of the
mass. Dotting with <m>(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)</m> gives
<m>\
m\ell\difftwo{\theta}{t}=-mg\sin\theta-\be \ell\diff{\theta}{t}
\ </m>
or
<me>
\difftwo{\theta}{t}+\frac{\be}{m}\diff{\theta}{t}
              +\frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta=0
</me>
which is the equation of motion of the (nonlinear) pendulum.
In general, it can be hard to analyse nonlinear differential
equations. But if the amplitude of oscillation is small enough
that we may approximate
<m>\sin\theta</m> by <m>\theta</m> we get the equation of motion
of the linear pendulum<fn>When <m>\be=0</m>, this equation reduces to the equation <m>\difftwo{\theta}{t}+\frac{g}{\ell}\theta=0</m>, which occurs
in many different applications, and whose solutions exhibit simple
harmonic motion.</fn> which is
<md>
<mrow>
\difftwo{\theta}{t}+\frac{\be}{m}\diff{\theta}{t}
+\frac{g}{\ell}\theta=0
</mrow>
</md>
These equations may be reformulated as systems of first order
ordinary differential equation, that is as equations for the
flow lines of a vector field, by the simple expedient of
defining (as we did in Example <xref ref="eg_Pendulum"/>)
<me>
x(t)=\theta(t)\qquad y(t)=\theta'(t)
</me>
Then, for the full, nonlinear, equation
<m> \difftwo{\theta}{t}+\frac{\be}{m}\diff{\theta}{t}
+\frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta=0</m>
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
x'(t)&amp;=&amp;\theta'(t)&amp;=y(t)\cr
y'(t)&amp;=&amp;\ \theta''(t)&amp;=-\frac{g}{\ell}\sin x(t)-\frac{\be}{m} y(t)
</mrow>
</md>
The solutions of this first order system of ordinary differential equations
are flow lines for the vector field
<me>
\vV\big((x,y)\big)=\Big(y\,,\,-\frac{g}{\ell}\sin x-\frac{\be}{m} y\Big)
</me>
When <m>\be=0</m>, this is exactly the vector field of Example <xref ref="eg_Pendulum"/>.
