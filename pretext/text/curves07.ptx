<title>Sliding on a Curve</title>

<introduction>
<p>We are going to investigate the motion of a particle of mass
<m>m</m> sliding on a frictionless<fn>We are mathematicians <mdash/> we like idealized situations.</fn>, smooth curve that lies in a vertical
plane. We will consider three scenarios:
<ul>
<li>
First, to set things up we'll look at a bead sliding on a stiff wire.
</li>
<li>
Then, we will imagine that we are skiing straight
downhill and ask <q>Where on the hill can we become airborne?</q>.
</li>
<li>
Then we will imagine that we are skateboarding in a
culvert (a large pipe) and ask <q>When is it safe?</q>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

</introduction>

<subsection><title>The Sliding Bead</title>
<p>
First, consider a bead of mass <m>m</m> that is sliding, without friction,
on a stiff wire. According to Newton's law of motion
<me>
m\va = \vF
</me>
where <m>\vF</m> is the net force being applied to the bead. The bead is
subject to two forces. The gravitational force is <m>-mg\hj</m>. By
definition, absence of friction means that the wire is does not apply
any force that is in the direction tangential to the wire. But, because
it is stiff, the wire never changes shape and instead applies just the right
amount of force, in the direction normal to the wire, that is needed
to keep the bead on the wire<fn>This force is required to keep
the bead from either passing through the wire or flying off the wire.</fn>
without bending the wire. Call this normal force <m>W\hat\vN</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="45%">
<image source="figs/wireC"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
So, by Newton's law,
<md>
<mrow  xml:id="eq_normalComp">
m\,\va=-mg\,\hj+W\,\hat\vN
</mrow>
</md>
We'll analyse this equation by splitting it into its tangential and
normal components.
</p>

<p>To extract the tangential component of Newton's law, we dot it with
<m>\vv=|\vv|\hat\vT</m>. Since <m>\hat\vT\cdot\hat\vN=0</m> this kills all normal
components.
<md>
<mrow>
m\vv\cdot\diff{\vv}{t}
&amp;=-mg\hj\cdot\vv+W\hat\vN\cdot\vv
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{1}{2}m\diff{\ }{t}(\vv\cdot\vv)&amp;=-mg\diff{y}{t}
</mrow>
</md>
Here we have used
<ul>
<li>
Theorem <xref ref="thm_DIFFalgebra"/>.c on the left hand side and
</li>
<li>
that <m>\hj\cdot\vv</m> is just the <m>y</m> component of <m>\vv</m> and
</li>
<li>
that <m>\hat\vN</m> and <m>\vv=|\vv|\hat\vT</m> are perpendicular.
</li>
</ul>
Moving everything to the left hand side of the equation gives
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{\ }{t}\left(\frac{1}{2}m|\vv|^2+mgy\right)&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
and we conclude that the quantity
</p>

<fact xml:id="eqn_consEnergy"><title>Conservation of Energy</title>
<statement><p>
<me>
E=\frac{1}{2}m|\vv|^2+mgy
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</fact>

<p>
is a constant, independent of time. This is, of course, the
principle of conservation of
energy. It determines the speed <m>|\vv|=\sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}-2gy}</m> of
the bead as a function of the height <m>y</m> (and of the energy <m>E</m>,
which is determined by the initial conditions).
</p>

<p>To extract the normal component of Newton's law,
we dot it with <m>\hat\vN</m>:
<me>
m\va\cdot \hat\vN=-mg\hj\cdot \hat\vN+W
</me>
Since
<me>
\va=\difftwo{s}{t}\,\hat\vT+\ka\Big(\diff{s}{t}\Big)^2\hat\vN
=\difftwo{s}{t}\,\hat\vT+\ka|\vv|^2\hat\vN
</me>
and <m>\hat\vT</m> and <m>\hat\vN</m> are perpendicular, this gives, after a little
rearrangement,
</p>

<fact xml:id="eqn_normalForce"><title>Normal Force</title>
<statement><p>
<me>
W=m\ka|\vv|^2+mg\hj\cdot \hat\vN
=2\ka(E-mgy)+mg\hj\cdot \hat\vN
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</fact>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>The Skier</title>

<p>
The difference between the bead on the wire and the skier on
the hill is that while the hill is capable of applying an upward normal
force (i.e. it can push you upward to keep you from falling to
the centre of the Earth), it is not capable of applying a downward
normal force. That is the hill cannot pull down on you to keep you
on the hill. Only gravity can keep you grounded. There are two
main possibilities.
</p>

<sidebyside widths="25% 25%" valign="middle">
<image source="figs/wireD"/>
<image source="figs/wireU"/>
</sidebyside>

<p><ul>
<li>
If the hill is concave downward as in the figure
on the left above, then <m>\hat\vN</m> points downward and the hill is
allowed to have
<m>W\le 0</m> (which corresponds to the normal force <m>W\hat\vN</m> pushing upward).
If ever <m>W \gt 0</m>, the hill would have to pull on you to keep you on hill.
It can't, so you become airborne. Since <m>\hj\cdot \hat\vN \lt 0</m>, this happens
whenever
<md>
<mrow>
W \gt 0 &amp;\iff m\ka|\vv|^2+mg\hj\cdot \hat\vN  \gt 0
    \iff |\vv|  \gt  \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ka}|\hj\cdot \hat\vN|}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li>
If the hill is concave upward as in the figure
on the right above, then <m>\hat\vN</m> points upward and the hill is
allowed to have <m>W\ge 0</m> (which corresponds to the normal force
<m>W\hat\vN</m> pushing upward). Since <m>\hj\cdot \hat\vN \gt 0</m> we always
have <m>W=m\ka|\vv|^2+mg\hj\cdot \hat\vN  \gt  0</m>.
You never become airborne. On the other hand your knees may complain.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<subsection><title>The Skate Boarder</title>

<p>
So far, Equations <xref ref="eqn_consEnergy"/> and <xref ref="eqn_normalForce"/>
apply to any stiff frictionless <q>wire</q>. We now
specialize  to the special case of a skateboarder inside a circular culvert
of radius <m>a</m>. Let's put the bottom of the circle at the origin <m>(0,0)</m>,
so that the centre of the circle is at <m>(0,a)</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="45%">
<image source="figs/circleC2"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
In this case the curvature is <m>\ \ka=\frac{1}{a}\ </m>
and
<m>
\hj\cdot\hat\vN=\cos \phi=\frac{a-y}{a}
</m>
so <xref ref="eqn_consEnergy"/> and <xref ref="eqn_normalForce"/>  simplify to
<md>
<mrow>
|\vv|&amp;=\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}(E-mgy)}=\sqrt{2g\Big(\frac{E}{mg}-y\Big)}
</mrow><mrow>
W&amp;=\frac{2}{a}(E-mgy)+\frac{mg}{a}(a-y)
=\frac{3mg}{a}\Big(\frac{2}{3mg}E+\frac{a}{3}-y\Big)
</mrow>
</md>
Imagine now that you start at the bottom of the culvert, that is at <m>y=0</m>,
with energy <m>E \gt 0</m>. As time progresses, <m>y</m> increases and consequently <m>|\vv|</m>
and <m>W</m> both decrease, as, of course, they should. This continues until one of the following three things happen.
<ol label="(i)">
<li>
<m>|\vv|</m> hits 0, in which case you stop rising and start descending.
The speed <m>|\vv|</m> is zero when <m>y=y_S=\frac{E}{mg}</m>.
(The subscript <q><m>S</m></q> stands for <q>stop</q>.) Physicists say that
when you reach <m>y_S</m> all of your kinetic energy (<m>\frac{1}{2}m|\vv|^2</m>)
has been converted into potential energy (<m>mgy</m>).
</li>
<li>
<m>W</m> hits zero. When you get higher than this, <m>W</m> becomes negative
and the culvert would have to pull on you to keep your feet on the culvert.
As the culvert can only push on you, you become airborne. The normal force
<m>W</m> is zero  when <m>y=y_A=\frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{mg}+\frac{a}{3}</m>.
(The subscript <q><m>A</m></q> stands for <q>airborne</q>.)
</li>
<li>
<m>y</m> hits <m>2a</m>. This is the summit of the culvert. You descend on the other side.
</li>
</ol>
Which case actually happens is determined by the relative sizes of <m>y_S,\ y_A</m> and <m>2a</m>.
<ul>
<li>
Comparing
<m>y_S=\frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{mg}+\frac{1}{3}\frac{E}{mg}</m> and
<m>y_A=\frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{mg}+\frac{a}{3}</m>, we see that
<m>y_S\le y_A\iff \frac{E}{mg}\le a </m>.
</li>
<li> Comparing
<m>y_A=\frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{mg}+\frac{a}{3}</m> and
<m>a=\frac{2}{3}a+\frac{a}{3}</m>, we see that
<m>y_A\le a\iff \frac{E}{mg}\le a</m>.
</li>
<li>
Comparing
<m>y_A=\frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{mg}+\frac{a}{3}</m> and
<m>2a=\frac{5}{3}a+\frac{a}{3}</m>, we see that
<m>y_A\le 2a\iff \frac{E}{mg}\le \frac{5}{2}a</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So the conclusions are:
<ul>
<li><em>If</em>  <m>\ {\bf 0\le\frac{E}{mg}\le a}\ </m> then
           <m>\ 0\le y_S\le y_A\le a\ </m>.
In this case you just oscillate between heights 0 and <m>y_S\le a</m> in
the bottom half of the culvert, as in the figure on the left below.
</li>
<li><em>If</em> <m>\ {\bf a\le\frac{E}{mg}\le \frac{5}{2}a}\ </m> then
<m>\ a\le y_A\le y_S,2a\ </m>.
In this case you make it more than half way to the top. But you
become airborne at <m>y=y_A</m> which is somewhere between the half way mark
<m>y=a</m> and the top <m>y=2a</m>.
At this point our model breaks down because you are no longer in
contact with the culvert. You just freely follow a parabolic arc until
you crash back into the culvert, as in the figure in the centre below.
</li>
<li><em>If</em> <m>\ {\bf \frac{5}{2}a  \lt  \frac{E}{mg}}\ </m> then
<m>\ 2a  \lt  y_A  \lt  y_S\ </m>.
In this case you
successfully go all the way around the culvert, looping  the loop,
as in the figure on the right below. Note that, as
<m>\frac{E}{mg}  \gt  \frac{5}{2}a  \gt 2a</m>,  this requires significantly
more energy than that required to reach the top, i.e. to reach height <m>2a</m>.
</li>
</ul>
