<title>Definitions and First Examples</title>


<p>In the last chapter, we studied vector valued functions of a single variable,
like, for example, the velocity <m>\vv(t)</m> of a particle at time <m>t</m>.
Suppose however that we are interested in a fluid.
There is a, possibly different, velocity at each point in the fluid.
So the velocity of a fluid is really a vector valued function
of several variables. Such a function is called a vector field.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_vectorField">
<statement><p>
<ol label="a">
<li>
A vector field in the plane is a rule which assigns to each point <m>(x,y)</m>
in a subset, <m>D</m>, of the <m>xy</m>-plane, a two component vector <m>\vv(x,y)</m>.
</li>
<li>
A vector field in space is a rule which assigns to each point <m>(x,y,z)</m>
in a subset of <m>\bbbr^3</m>, a three component vector <m>\vv(x,y,z)</m>.
</li>
</ol>
</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Here are two typical applications that naturally involve vector fields.
<ul>
<li>
If <m>\vv(x,y,z)</m> is the velocity of a moving fluid at position <m>(x,y,z)</m>,
then <m>\vv</m> is called a <term>velocity field</term>.
</li>
<li>
If <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> is the force at position <m>(x,y,z)</m>,
then <m>\vF</m> is called<fn>No, force fields are not only a sci-fi trope. Gravity is an example of a force field.</fn>
a <term>force field</term>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_ptSource"><title>The Point Source</title>
<p>
Imagine
<ul>
<li>
The whole world  is filled with an incompressible fluid. Call it water.
</li>
<li>
Somehow you find a way to produce still more water at the origin. Say you
create <m>4\pi m</m> litres per second.
</li>
<li> This forces the water to flow outward. Let's suppose that
it flows symmetrically outward from the origin.
</li>
</ul>
Let's find the resulting vector field <m>\vv(x,y,z)</m>. As the flow is to be
symmetric, the velocity of the water at the point <m>(x,y,z)</m>
<ul>
<li>
has to be pointing radially outward from the origin. That is, the
direction of the velocity vector <m>\vv(x,y,z)</m> has to be the unit radial vector
<me>
\hat\vr(x,y,z) = \frac{x\hi + y\hj + z\hk}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}
</me>
</li>
<li>
The magnitude of the velocity, i.e. the speed <m>|\vv(x,y,z)|</m> of the water,
has to depend only on the distance from the origin. That is, the
speed can only be some function of
<me>
r(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
</me>
</li>
</ul>
Thus the velocity field is of the form
<me>
\vv(x,y,z) = v\big(r(x,y,z)\big)\,\hat\vr(x,y,z)
</me>
We just have to determine the function <m>v(r)</m>. Fix any <m>r \gt 0</m> and
concentrate on the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2</m>. It is sketched in red
in the figure below.
</p>

<sidebyside width="35%">
<image source="figs/waterField2"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
During a very short time interval <m>dt</m> seconds, <m>4\pi m\,dt</m> litres
of water is created at the origin (which is the red dot). As the water
is incompressible, <m>4\pi m\,dt</m> litres of water must exit through
the sphere during the same time interval to make room for the newly
created water.
</p>

<p>But, at the surface of the sphere the water is flowing radially outward
with speed <m>v(r)</m>. So during the time interval in question the water near the surface of
the sphere moves outward a distance <m>v(r)\,dt</m>, and in particular the water
that was in the thin spherical shell
<m>\ \ r-v(r)\,dt \le \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \le r\ \ </m> at the beginning of
the time interval exits through the sphere <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = r</m>
during the time interval. The shell is sketched in gray in the figure
above. The volume of water in the gray shell is essentially the surface
area of the shell, which is <m>4\pi r^2</m>, times the thickness of the
shell, which is <m>v(r)\,dt</m>. So, equating the volume of water created inside
the sphere with the volume of water that exited the sphere,
<me>
4\pi m\,dt =  (4\pi r^2) \big(v(r)\,dt\big)
\implies v(r) = \frac{4\pi m}{4\pi r^2} =\frac{m}{r^2}
</me>
Thus our vector field is
<me>
\vv(x,y,z) = \frac{m}{r(x,y,z)^2}\,\hat\vr(x,y,z)
</me>
If the world were two, rather than three dimensional<fn>You might want to think about what happens in <m>d</m> dimensions for general <m>d</m>.</fn>, and the source created <m>2\pi m</m> litres per second, the same argument leads to
<me>
2\pi m\,dt =  (2\pi r) \big(v(r)\,dt\big)
\implies v(r) = \frac{2\pi m}{2\pi r} =\frac{m}{r}
</me>
and to the vector field
<me>
\vv(x,y) = \frac{m}{r(x,y)}\,\hat\vr(x,y)\qquad
r(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\qquad
\hat\vr(x,y) = \frac{x\hi + y\hj}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}
</me>
To get a mental image of what this field looks like, imagine
sketching, for each point <m>(x,y)</m>, the vector
<m>\frac{m}{r(x,y)}\,\hat\vr(x,y)</m> with its tail at
<m>(x,y)</m>. Note that the vector  <m>\frac{m}{r(x,y)}\,\hat\vr(x,y)</m>
<ul>
<li>
points radially outward and
</li>
<li><p>
has length <m>\frac{m}{r(x,y)}</m> which
<ul>
<li>
depends only on <m>r=|(x,y)|</m> and
</li>
<li>
is very long when <m>(x,y)</m> is near the origin and
</li>
<li>
decreases in length like <m>\frac{1}{r}</m> as <m>r=|(x,y)|</m> increases.
</li>
</ul></p>
</li>
</ul>
Here is a sketch of a bunch of such vectors.
</p>

<figure xml:id="fig_sourceField">

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="figs/waterField"/>
</sidebyside>
</figure>

<p>Note that as <m>|(x,y)|\rightarrow 0</m>, the magnitude of the velocity
<m>|\vv(x,y)|\rightarrow\infty</m>. This is a consequence of our idealized
assumption that we are producing water at a single point (the origin).
</p></example>

<example xml:id="eg_Vortex"><title>The Vortex</title>
<p>
In this example, we sketch the vector field
<me>
\vv(x,y) = \Om\big(-y\hi +x\hj\big)
</me>
where <m>\Om</m> is just a strictly positive constant.
We give an efficient procedure for getting a rough sketch, which still
provides a pretty realistic picture of the vector field, and which also
generalises to other vector fields.
First concentrate
on the horizontal component <m>\hi\cdot\vv(x,y)</m> of the vector field and
determine in which part of the <m>xy</m>-plane it is zero, in which part
it is positive and in which part it is negative.
<me>
\hi\cdot\vv(x,y)
=-\Om y\ \
\begin{cases}
   =0 &amp;\text{if } y=0\\
    \lt 0 &amp;\text{if } y \gt 0\\
    \gt 0 &amp;\text{if } y \lt 0
\end{cases}
</me>
Next repeat with the vertical component.
<me>
\hj\cdot\vv(x,y)
= \Om x\ \
\begin{cases}
   =0 &amp;\text{if } x=0 \\
    \lt 0 &amp;\text{if } x \lt 0 \\
    \gt 0 &amp;\text{if } x \gt 0
\end{cases}
</me>
This naturally divides the <m>xy</m>-plane into nine parts according to whether
each of the components is positive, <m>0</m> or negative <mdash/>
<ul>
<li>
<m>\hi\cdot\vv \gt 0</m> and <m>\hj\cdot\vv \gt 0</m>
in <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y \lt 0,\ x \gt 0\ \big\}</m>
</li>
<li>
<m>\hi\cdot\vv \gt 0</m> and <m>\hj\cdot\vv=0</m>
in <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y \lt 0,\ x=0\ \big\}</m>
</li>
<li>
<m>\hi\cdot\vv \gt 0</m> and <m>\hj\cdot\vv \lt 0</m>
in <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y \lt 0,\ x \lt 0\ \big\}</m>
</li>
<li>
<m>\hi\cdot\vv=0</m> and <m>\hj\cdot\vv \gt 0</m>
in <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y=0,\ x \gt 0\ \big\}</m>
</li>
<li>
and so on
</li>
</ul>
Now think of <m>\vv(x,y)</m> as being the velocity at <m>(x,y)</m> of a flowing fluid.
<ul>
<li><p>
Look at the first bullet point above. It says that in the first of the nine
parts, namely <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y \lt 0,\ x \gt 0\ \big\}</m>,
which is the fourth quadrant,
the horizontal component  <m>\hi\cdot\vv \gt 0</m> signifying that the fluid is flowing
rightwards. Indicate this in the sketch by drawing a rightward pointing
horizontal arrow at some generic point in the middle of the fourth quadrant.
(It's the blue arrow in the figure below.)
The vertical component  <m>\hj\cdot\vv \gt 0</m> signifying that the fluid is
also moving upwards. Indicate this in the sketch by drawing an upward
pointing vertical arrow at the same generic point in the fourth quadrant.
(It's the red arrow in the figure below.)
</p>

<sidebyside width="43%">
<image source="figs/phaseVortex4"/>
</sidebyside>

</li>
<li><p>
Next, look at the second bullet point above. It says that on the second of the nine parts, namely <m>\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\  y \lt 0,\ x=0\ \big\}</m>,
which is the bottom half of the <m>y</m>-axis,
the horizontal component  <m>\hi\cdot\vv \gt 0</m>, signifying that the fluid is moving
rightwards. Indicate this in the sketch by drawing a rightward pointing
horizontal arrow at some generic point in the middle of the bottom half
of the <m>y</m>-axis. (It's the second blue arrow in the figure below.)
The vertical component  <m>\hj\cdot\vv=0</m> signifying that the fluid has
no vertical motion at all. Indicate this in the sketch by not drawing any
vertical arrow on the bottom half of the <m>y</m>-axis.
</p>

<sidebyside width="43%">
<image source="figs/phaseVortex5"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li>
and so on
</li>
</ul>
By the time we have looked at all nine regions we will have built up the
following sketch.
</p>

<figure xml:id="fig_vortexCrude">

<sidebyside width="43%">
<image source="figs/phaseVortex1"/>
</sidebyside>
</figure>

<p>
From this sketch we see that, for example, in the first quadrant,
the fluid is moving upwards and to the left. We also see that there is one
point, namely <m>(0,0)</m>, where the vector field is exactly zero. It's the
black dot in the centre of the figure above.
Putting all of this
accumulated wisdom together, and also noticing that <m>\vv(x,y)</m> is smaller
when <m>(x,y)</m> is closer to the origin and <m>\vv(x,y)</m> is larger when
<m>(x,y)</m> is farther from the origin, we come up with this better
sketch of the vector field.

This shows the field swirling around the origin in a counterclockwise direction.
Hence the name <q>vortex</q>.

<example xml:id="eg_Pendulum"><title>The Undamped Nonlinear Pendulum</title>
<p>
In this example, we illustrate another way in which  vector fields
arise. Model a pendulum by a mass <m>m</m> that is connected to a hinge by
an idealized rod that is massless<fn>While we are idealizing, let's put everything in a vacuum.</fn>
 and of fixed length <m>\ell</m>. Denote by <m>\theta</m> the angle

<ul>
<li>
gravity and
</li>
<li>
the tension in the rod, whose magnitude, <m>\tau</m>, automatically adjusts
itself so that the distance between the mass and the hinge is
fixed at <m>\ell</m>.

</ul>

rightward motion<fn>Note that this is rightward motion of the point <m>(x,y)</m>, not of the pendulum itself.</fn>
 when <m>y \gt 0</m>
