<title>Optional <mdash/> Which Vector Fields Obey  <m>\vnabla\times\vF=0</m></title>


<p>We already know that if a vector field <m>\vF</m> passes the screening
test <m>\vnabla\times\vF=0</m> on <em>all</em> of <m>\bbbr^2</m> or <m>\bbbr^3</m>,
then there is a function <m>\varphi</m> with <m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m>.
That is, <m>\vF</m> is conservative.  We are now going to take a first look
at what happens<fn>Russell Crowe posed a related question in the movie
<em>A Beautiful Mind</em>. The movie is based on the life of the American mathematician John Nash, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics.</fn>
 when <m>\vF</m> passes the screening test <m>\vnabla\times\vF=0</m>
only on some proper subset <m>\cD</m> of <m>\bbbr^n</m>, <m>n=2</m> or <m>3</m>.
We will just scratch the surface of this topic <mdash/> there is a whole subbranch
of Mathematics (cohomology theory, which is part of algebraic topology)
concerned with a general form of this question.
We shall imagine that we are given a vector field <m>\vF</m> that is only
defined on <m>\cD</m> and we shall assume
<ul>
<li>
that <m>\cD</m> is a connected, open subset of <m>\bbbr^n</m> with <m>n=2</m> or <m>n=3</m>
(see Definition <xref ref="def_COopen"/>, below)
</li>
<li>
that all first order derivatives of all vector fields
and functions that we consider are continuous and
</li>
<li><p>
that all curves we consider are piecewise smooth. A curve
is piecewise smooth if it is a union of a finite number of smooth curves
<m>\cC_1,\cC_2,\cdots,\cC_m</m> with the end
point of <m>\cC_i</m> being the beginning point of <m>\cC_{i+1}</m>
for each <m>1\le i \lt m</m>. A curve is smooth<fn>The word <q>smooth</q> does
not have a universal meaning in mathematics. It is used with different meanings in different contexts. We are here using one of
the standard definitions. Another standard definition requires that
all derivatives of all orders are continuous.</fn> if it has a
parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m>, <m>a\le t\le b</m>, whose first
derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> exists, is continuous and is
nonzero everywhere.

Let <m>n\ge 1</m> be an integer.

B_\veps(\va)=\big\{\ \vx\in\bbbr^n\ \big|\ |\vx-\va| \lt \veps\ \big\}

<li>
A subset <m>\cO\subset\bbbr^n</m> is said to be an <q>open subset
of <m>\bbbr^n</m></q> if, for each
point <m>\va\in\cO</m>, there is an <m>\veps \gt 0</m> such that <m>B_\veps(\va)\subset\cO</m>.
Equivalently, <m>\cO</m> is open if and only if it is a union of open balls.
</li>
<li> A subset <m>\cD\subset\bbbr^n</m> is said to be (pathwise)

<p>
Here are some examples to help explain this definition.

The <term>open rectangle</term>
           <m>\cO=\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\ 0 \lt x \lt 1,\ 0 \lt y \lt 1\ \big\}</m>
is an open subset of <m>\bbbr^2</m> because any point <m>\va=(x_0,y_0)\in\cO</m>
is a nonzero distance, namely <m>d=\min\big\{x_0,1-x_0,y_0,1-y_0\big\}</m> away

The <term>closed rectangle</term>
   <m>\cC=\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\ 0\le x \le 1,\ 0 \le y \le 1\ \big\}</m>
is <em>not</em> an open subset of <m>\bbbr^2</m>. For example,
<m>\vZero=(0,0)</m> is a point in <m>\cC</m>. No matter what <m>\veps \gt 0</m> we pick,
the open ball <m>B_\veps(\vZero)</m> is not contained in <m>\cC</m> because

<p>Many, but not all, of the basic facts that we developed, in ยง<xref ref="sec_pathIndep"/>,
about conservative fields in <m>\bbbr^n</m> also applies (with the same proofs)
to fields on <m>\cD</m>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_COpathIndep">
<statement><p>
For a vector field <m>\vF</m>

&amp;\ \Longrightarrow \vnabla\times \vF=0\ \text{ on $\cD$}
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Note that the last line of this theorem contains only a one way implication.
</p>

<p>Combining this with Stokes' Theorem <xref ref="thm_Stokes"/>
(when <m>n=3</m>, or Green's Theorem <xref ref="thm_Green"/> when <m>n=2</m>) gives us the following two consequences.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_closedExact">
<statement><p>
<ol marker="a">
<li>
If <m>\cD</m> has the property that
<me>
\begin{split}
&amp;\text{every closed curve $\cC$ in $\cD$ is the boundary} \\
&amp;\text{of a bounded oriented surface, $\cS$, in $\cD$}
\end{split}
\tag{H}
</me>
then
<me>
\vF\text{ is conservative on $\cD$}
\iff \vnabla\times \vF=0\text{ on $\cD$}
</me>
</li>
<li>
For any <m>\cD</m>, if <m>\vnabla\times \vF=0</m> on <m>\cD</m>,
then <m>\vF</m> is locally conservative. This means that for each point
<m>\vx_0\in\cD</m>, there is an <m>\veps \gt 0</m> and a function <m>\varphi</m> such that
<m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m> on <m>B_\veps(\vx_0)</m>.
</li>
</ol>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p> (a)
This is simply because if <m>\vnabla\times\vF=0</m> on <m>\cD</m> and if
the curve <m>\cC=\partial\cS</m>,
with <m>\cS</m> an oriented surface in <m>\cD</m>, then Stokes' theorem gives
<me>
\int_\cC \vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\int_{\partial\cS} \vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_\cS \vnabla\times \vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}=0
</me>
So <m>\vF</m> is conservative by Theorem <xref ref="thm_COpathIndep"/>.
</p>

<p> (b)
This is true simply because <m>B_\veps(\vx_0)</m> satisfies property (H).
</p></proof>


<example xml:id="ex_COhomology">
<p>
Here are some examples of <m>\cD</m>'s that violate (H).
<ul>
<li>
When <m>\cD=\cD_1=\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\ 0 \lt |(x,y)| \lt 3\big\}</m>
(an open ball with its centre removed), then
the circle <m>x^2+y^2=4</m> is a curve in <m>\cD</m> that is not the boundary
of a surface in <m>\cD</m>. The circle <m>x^2+y^2=4</m> is the boundary of
the disk <m>x^2+y^2 \lt 4</m>, but the disk <m>x^2+y^2 \lt 4</m> is not contained in
<m>\cD</m> because the point <m>(0,0)</m> is in the disk and not in <m>\cD</m>.
See the figure on the left below.
</li>
<li><p>
When <m>\cD=\cD_2
   =\big\{\ (x,y,z)\in\bbbr^3\ \big|\ |(x,y,z)| \lt 2, |(x,y)| \gt 0\big\}</m>
(an open ball with the <m>z</m>-axis removed), then
the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m> is a curve in <m>\cD</m> that is not the boundary
of a surface in <m>\cD</m>. The circle is the boundary of many different
surfaces in <m>\bbbr^3</m>, but each contains a point on the <m>z</m>-axis and
so is  not contained in <m>\cD</m>. See the figure in the centre below.

<image source="figs/pDisk"/>

</sidebyside>
</li>
</ul>
On the other hand, here is an example which does satisfy (H).
<ul>
<li>
Let <m>\cD=\cD_3=\big\{\ (x,y,z)\in\bbbr^3\ \big|\ 0 \lt |(x,y,z)| \lt 2\big\}</m>
(an open ball with its centre removed).
For example the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>  is the boundary of the surface
<m>\big\{\ (x,y,z)\in\bbbr^3\ \big|\ x^2+y^2+z^2=1, z \gt 0\big\}\subset\cD</m>.
See the figure on the right above.
</li>
</ul>
</p></example>

<p>
This leaves the question of what happens when (H) is violated.
We'll just look at one example, which however gives the flavour of the
general theory.
</p>

<p>The punctured disk is</p>
<sidebyside widths="45% 15%" valign="middle">
<p><me>
\cD=\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\ 0 \lt |(x,y)| \lt 1\ \big\}
</me></p>
<image source="figs/pDisk2"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
We'll start by looking at one particular vector field, which passes the
screening test, but which cannot possibly be conservative. The field,
which we saw in Example <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/>, is
<me>
\vTh =-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\hi + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\hj
</me>
with domain of definition <m>\cD</m>. We'll first check that it passes
the screening test:
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\times\vTh
&amp;=\Big\{\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\Big(\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\Big)
-\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\Big(-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\Big)\Big\}\hk
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\Big\{\Big(\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}-\frac{2x^2}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}\Big)
+\Big(\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}-\frac{2y^2}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}\Big)\Big\}\hk
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
Next we'll check that it cannot be conservative.
Denote by <m>\cC_\veps</m> the circle <m>x^2+y^2=\veps^2</m>, with counterclockwise
orientation. Parametrize <m>\cC_\veps</m> by
<m>\vr(\theta)=\veps\cos\theta\,\hi+\veps\sin\theta\,\hj</m> with
<m>0\le\theta\le2\pi</m>. Then
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\int_{\cC_\veps}\vTh\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\int_0^{2\pi} \vTh\big(\vr(\theta)\big)\cdot\frac{\dee{\vr}}{d\theta}(\theta)\

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip0.25in=\int_0^{2\pi}
       \Big(-\frac{1}{\veps}\sin\theta\,\hi
                   +\frac{1}{\veps}\cos\theta\,\hj\Big)
  \cdot\big(-\veps\sin\theta\,\hi+\veps\cos\theta\,\hj\big)\ d\theta
\tag{E1}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip0.25in=\int_0^{2\pi} \!\! d\theta\\
&amp;\hskip0.25in=2\pi
</mrow>
</md>
is not zero. By Theorem <xref ref="thm_COpathIndep"/>, <m>\vTh</m> cannot be
conservative on the punctured disk since the integral
<m>\int_{\cC_\veps}\vTh\cdot \dee{\vr}</m> around the closed curve <m>\cC_\veps</m> is
nonzero.
</p>

<p>Next we'll check that it is locally conservative. That is, it can be written
in the form <m>\vnabla\theta(x,y)</m> near any point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in its domain.
Define <m>\theta(x,y)</m> to be the polar angle of <m>(x,y)</m> with, for example,
<m>-\pi \lt \theta \lt \pi</m>. This <m>\theta</m> is defined on all of <m>\cD</m>,
<em>except</em> for the negative real axis. The domain of definition,
<m>\cD_\pi</m>, is sketched on the left below.
</p>

<sidebyside widths="19% 19%" valign="middle">
<image source="figs/pDiskPi"/>
<image source="figs/pDisk0"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
If <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> happens to lie on the negative real
axis, just replace <m>-\pi \lt \theta \lt \pi</m> by a different interval of length <m>2\pi</m>,
like <m>0 \lt \theta \lt 2\pi</m>.  The domain of definition of <m>\theta</m> would then change
to the <m>\cD_0</m>, sketched on the right above.
</p>

<p>It's now a simple matter to check that <m>\vnabla\theta(x,y)=\vTh(x,y)</m>
on the domain of definition of <m>\theta</m>. If <m>x\ne 0</m>, then, from the
figure below,
</p>

<sidebyside width="34%">

</sidebyside>

<p>
we have that <m>\tan\theta(x,y)=\frac{y}{x}</m>, and
<m>\cos\theta(x,y) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}</m>, so that
<md alignment="alignat">

If <m>x=0</m>, then we must have <m>y\ne 0</m> (since <m>(0,0)</m> is not in the domain of definition to <m>\theta</m>), and we can use <m>\cot\theta(x,y)=\frac{x}{y}</m>
instead and arrive at the same result.
</p>

<p>
So far we have just looked at one vector field on <m>\cD</m>.
We are  now ready to consider any vector field <m>\vF</m> on <m>\cD</m> that
passes the screening test <m>\vnabla\times\vF=0</m> on <m>\cD</m>. We claim that
there is a function <m>\varphi</m> on <m>\cD</m> such that
<me>
\vF=\alpha_\vF\,\vTh+\vnabla\varphi\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\alpha_\vF = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
\tag{E2}</me>
The significance of this claim is that it says that if a vector field on
<m>\cD</m> passes the screening test on <m>\cD</m>, then, either it is conservative
(that's the case if and only if <m>\alpha_\vF=0</m>) or, if it fails to be
conservative, then it differs from a conservative field (namely
<m>\vnabla\varphi</m>) only by
a constant (namely <m>\alpha_\vF</m>) times the fixed vector field <m>\vTh</m>.
That is, there is only one nonconservative vector field on <m>\cD</m> that
passes the screening test, up to multiplication by constants and addition
of conservative fields.  This is a nice simple surprise.
</p>

<p>Observe that in the definition of <m>\alpha_\vF</m>, we did not specify the radius
<m>\veps</m> of the circle <m>\cC_\veps</m> to be used for the integration curve.
That's because the answer to the integral does not depend on the choice
of <m>\veps</m>. To see this, take any <m>0 \lt \veps' \lt \veps \lt 1</m> and consider the
surface <m>S=\big\{\ (x,y)\in\bbbr^2\ \big|\ \veps' \lt |(x,y)| \lt \veps\big\}</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="45%">
<image source="figs/pDisk3"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
It is completely contained in <m>\cD</m>.  The boundary of <m>S</m> consists of two
parts. The outside part is <m>\cC_\veps</m>, oriented counterclockwise as usual.
The inside part is <m>\cC_{\veps'}</m>, but oriented clockwise. It is usually
denoted <m>-\cC_{\veps'}</m>. So, by Stokes' theorem,
<md>
<mrow>
\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
        -\oint_{\cC_{\veps'}}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
&amp;=\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
        +\oint_{-\cC_{\veps'}}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\oint_{\partial S}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
=0
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Finally to verify the claim (E2), we check that the
vector field <m>\vG=\vF-\alpha_\vF\vTh</m>
is conservative on <m>\cD</m>. To do so, it suffices to check that
<m>\oint_{\cC}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}=0</m> for any closed curve <m>\cC</m> in <m>\cD</m>.
In fact we can restrict our attention to curves <m>\cC</m> that are simple,
closed, counterclockwise oriented curves on <m>\cD</m>. A curve is called
simple if it does not cross itself. Closed curves which are not simple
can be split up into simple closed subcurves. And changing the
orientation of <m>\cC</m> just changes the sign of
<m>\oint_{\cC}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}=0</m>,
which does not affect whether it is zero or not.
</p>

<p>So let <m>\cC</m> be
a simple, closed, counterclockwise oriented curve in <m>\cD</m>. We need
to verify that <m>\oint_\cC\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}=0</m>. Any simple closed curve in
<m>\bbbr^2</m> divides <m>\bbbr^2</m> into three mutually disjoint
subsets<fn>This, intuitively obvious, but hard to prove, result
is called the Jordan curve theorem. It is named after the French mathematician
Camille Jordan (1838<ndash/>1922), who first proved it.</fn>
 <mdash/>
<m>\cC</m> itself, the set of points inside <m>\cC</m> and the set of points
outside <m>\cC</m>. Since <m>(0,0)</m> is not on <m>\cC</m>, it must be either outside <m>\cC</m>,
as in the figure of the left below,  or inside <m>\cC</m> as in the figure on the right below.

In this case <m>\cC</m> is the boundary of a set, <m>S</m>, which is completely

So, by Stokes' theorem,

is between <m>\cC_\veps</m> and <m>\cC</m>.  So, by Stokes' theorem,
<md>
<mrow>
\oint_{\cC}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
        -\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
&amp;=\oint_{\cC-\cC_\veps}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\oint_{\partial S}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vG\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
since <m>\vnabla\times\vG=\vnabla\times\vF-\alpha_\vF\vnabla\times\vTh=0</m> on
<m>\cD</m>. Hence
<me>
\oint_{\cC}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vG\cdot \dee{\vr}
=\oint_{\cC_\veps}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
     -\alpha_\vF \oint_{\cC_\veps}\vTh\cdot \dee{\vr}
=2\pi\alpha_\vF -\alpha_\vF(2\pi)=0
</me>
by the definition, (E2), of <m>\alpha_\vF</m> and (E1).
</li>
</ul>
So <m>\vG</m> is conservative on <m>\cD</m> and <m>\vF</m> is of the form
(E2) on <m>\cD</m>.
</p>

<p>The ideas that we have explored here can be generalised quite a bit.
For example, if we had a disk with <m>n \gt 1</m> punctures, we could use
arguments like those above to show that any vector field <m>\vF</m> that passes
the screening test has to be of the form
<me>
\vF=\vnabla\varphi + \sum_{\ell=1}^n \alpha_\ell\,\vTh_\ell
</me>
with <m>\vTh_\ell</m> simply being the above <m>\vTh</m> translated so as to be
centered on the <m>\ell^{\rm th}</m> puncture.
