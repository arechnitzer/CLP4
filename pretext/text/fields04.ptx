<title>Line Integrals</title>

<introduction>
<p>
We have already seen, in ยง<xref ref="sec_lineIntegral"/>, one type of integral along
curves. We are now going to see a second, that turns out to have significant
connections to conservative vector fields. It arose from the concept of
<q>work</q> in classical mechanics.
</p>

<p>Suppose that we wish to find the work done by a force <m>\vF(\vr)</m> moving a particle
along a path <m>\vr(t)</m>. During the <q>infinitesimal time interval</q><fn>Yes, yes. We should first consider short time intervals <m>\De t \gt 0</m> and then take the limit <m>\De t\rightarrow 0</m> at the end. But you have undoubtedly used this
type of argument so many times before that you would be thoroughly
bored by it.</fn>
from <m>t</m> to <m>t+\dee{t}</m>  the particle moves from <m>\vr(t)</m> to <m>\vr(t)+\dee{\vr}</m> with <m>\dee{\vr}=\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\,\dee{t}</m>. By definition, the work done
during that infinitesimal time interval is
<me>
\vF\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot\dee{\vr} = \vF\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot
\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\,\dee{t}
</me>
The total work done during the time interval from <m>t_0</m> to <m>t_1</m> is then
<me>
\text{Work} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}\vF\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\,\dee{t}
</me>
There are some useful shorthand notations for this work.
</p>

<definition xml:id="not_workIntegral">
<statement><p>
Denote by <m>\cC</m> the parametrized path <m>\vr(t)</m> with <m>t_0\le t\le t_1</m>.
Then
<me>
\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_\cC\big(\vF_1\dee{x}+\vF_2\dee{y}+\vF_3\dee{z}\big)
=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\vF\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\,\dee{t}
</me>
If <m>\cC</m> is a closed path, the notation <m>\oint_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m>
is also used.
</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>In the event that <m>\vF</m> is conservative, and we know the potential <m>\varphi</m>,
the following theorem provides a really easy way to compute
<q>work integrals</q>. The theorem is a generalization of the fundamental theorem
of calculus, and indeed some people call it the fundamental theorem of line integrals.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_workIntegral">
<statement><p>
Let <m>\vF=\nabla\varphi</m> be a conservative vector field. Then if <m>\cC</m> is
any curve that starts at <m>P_0</m> and ends at <m>P_1</m>, we have<fn>So <m>\varphi</m> acts a bit like the antiderivative of first year calculus.</fn>
<me>
\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} =\varphi(P_1)-\varphi(P_0)
</me>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>\vr(t)=\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)</m>, <m>t_0\le t\le t_1</m>,
be any parametrization of <m>\cC</m> with <m>\vr(t_0)=P_0</m> and <m>\vr(t_1)=P_1</m>.
Then, by definition,

</p></proof>

<p>
Observe that, in Theorem <xref ref="thm_workIntegral"/>, the value,
<m>\varphi(P_1)-\varphi(P_0)</m>, of the integral <m>\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m>
depended only on the endpoints <m>P_0</m> and <m>P_1</m> of the curve, not on the path
that the curve followed to get to <m>P_0</m> from <m>P_1</m>. We shall see, in Theorem
<xref ref="thm_pathIndepConserv"/>, below, that this happens only for
conservative vector fields.
Here are several examples of line integrals of vector fields that are not
conservative.

This time we consider two curves.

We parametrize <m>\cC_1</m> by <m>\vr(t) = \cos t\,\hi+\sin t\,\hj</m> with <m>t</m>

You could evaluate these integrals using double angle trig identities
like you did in first year calculus. But there is a sneaky, much easier, way.
Because <m>\sin^2 t</m> and <m>\cos^2 t</m> are translates of each other, and both are
periodic of period <m>\pi</m>, the two integrals
<m>\int_0^{2\pi}\sin ^2 t\,\dee{t}</m> and <m>\int_0^{2\pi}\cos ^2 t\,\dee{t}</m>
represent the same area and so are equal. See the figure below.

Thus

<mrow>
\int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2 t\,\dee{t}

<example xml:id="eg_workIntegalC">

In Example <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/>, we saw that the vector field

conservative. In this example, we will see that this <m>\vF</m> violates the
conclusion of Theorem <xref ref="thm_workIntegral"/>, thereby providing a second proof
that <m>\vF(x,y)</m> is not conservative on <m>\bbbr^2</m> with <m>(0,0)</m> removed.
For the curve <m>\cC</m>, of Theorem <xref ref="thm_workIntegral"/>, we use the circle

P_1&amp;=(a\cos\theta,\ a\sin\theta)\big|_{\theta=2\pi} = (a,0) =P_0

So, if <m>\vF</m> were conservative with potential <m>\varphi</m>,
Theorem <xref ref="thm_workIntegral"/> would give that
<me>
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\cC \frac{x\,\dee{y}-y\,\dee{x}}{x^2+y^2}

Consequently, <m>\vF</m> can't be conservative.

<subsection xml:id="sec_pathIndep">
<title>Path Independence</title>

<p>This brings us to the following question. Let <m>\vF</m> be any fixed vector field.
When is it true that, given any two fixed points <m>P_0</m> and <m>P_1</m>,
the integrals
<me>
\int_{\cC}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}=
\int_{\cC'}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
</me>
for all curves <m>\cC</m>, <m>\cC'</m> that start at <m>P_0</m> and end at <m>P_1</m>?
When can we ignore the path taken?
If this is the case we say that
<q><m>\int_{\cC}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> is independent of the path chosen</q>
and we write
<me>
\int_{P_0}^{P_1}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
=\int_{\cC}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
</me>
for any path <m>\cC</m> from <m>P_0</m> to <m>P_1</m>.
The point of this section is that there is an intimate relation between
path independence and conservativeness of vector fields, that we will
get to in Theorem <xref ref="thm_pathIndepConserv"/>.
</p>

<p> For simplicity, we will consider only vector fields that are defined and continuous on all of <m>\bbbr^2</m>
(i.e. the <m>xy</m>-plane) or <m>\bbbr^3</m> (i.e. the usual three dimensional world).
Some discussion about what happens for vector fields that are defined only
on part of <m>\bbbr^2</m> or <m>\bbbr^3</m> is given in the optional
ยง<xref ref="sec_cohomology"/>.
</p>

<p>First we show that if there is one pair of (not necessarily distinct)
points <m>P_0</m>, <m>P_1</m> such that
<me>
\int_{\cC_1}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}=
\int_{\cC_2}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}
</me>
for all curves <m>\cC_1</m>, <m>\cC_2</m> that start at <m>P_0</m> and end at <m>P_1</m>,
then it is also true that, for <em>any</em> other pair of points

<me>
\int_{\cC'_1}\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}=

</me>
for all curves <m>\cC'_1</m>, <m>\cC'_2</m> that start at <m>P'_0</m> and end at <m>P'_1</m>.
This might seem unlikely at first, but the idea of the proof is really
intuitive.

<m>\oint_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}=0</m> for all curves that start at <m>P_0</m> and end at <m>P_1</m>.
In particular  <m>\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> takes the same value for all curves
that start at <m>P_0</m> and end at <m>P_1</m>.
So Theorem <xref ref="thm_pathIndepArbEndPoints"/> immediately yields
property (c).
</p>

<p> (c)<m>\implies</m>(a):
We are to show that <m>\vF</m> is conservative.
We'll start by guessing <m>\varphi</m> and then we'll verify that, for our
chosen <m>\varphi</m>, we really do have <m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m>. Our guess for
<m>\varphi</m> is motivated by Theorem <xref ref="thm_workIntegral"/>. If our <m>\vF</m> really is conservative, its potential is going to have to obey
<m>\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr} =\varphi(P_1) - \varphi(P_0)</m> for any curve <m>\cC</m> that starts at <m>P_0</m> and ends at <m>P_1</m>. Let's choose <m>P_0=\vZero</m>. Remembering,
from Definition <xref ref="def_conservative"/>.a, that adding a constant to a
potential always yields another potential, we can always choose
<m>\varphi(\vZero)=0</m>. Then <m>\varphi(P_1)=\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> for any
curve <m>\cC</m> that starts at <m>\vZero</m> and ends at <m>P_1</m>. So define,
for each point <m>\vx</m>, <m>\varphi(\vx)=\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> for any
curve <m>\cC</m> that starts at <m>\vZero</m> and ends at <m>\vx</m>.
</p>

<p>We now verify that, for this chosen <m>\varphi</m>, we really do have <m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m>.
Fix any point <m>\vx</m> and any curve <m>\cC_{\vx}</m> that
starts at the origin and ends at <m>\vx</m>.
For any vector <m>\vu</m>, let <m>\cD_{\vu}</m> be the curve with parametrization
<me>
\vr_{\vu}(t)=\vx+t\vu\qquad 0\le t\le 1
</me>
This curve is a line segment that starts at <m>\vx</m> at <m>t=0</m> and ends at <m>\vx+\vu</m> at <m>t=1</m>.
Observe that <m>{\vr\,}'_{\vu}(t)=\vu</m>.
Recall that, by assumption, <m>\varphi(\vx+s\vu)=\int_\cC\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}</m> for <em>any</em>
curve <m>\cC</m> that starts at <m>\vZero</m> and ends at <m>\vx+s\vu</m>. So
<me>
\varphi(\vx+s\vu)
=\int_{\cC_{\vx}+\cD_{s\vu}}\vF\cdot d\vr
</me>
where <m>C_{\vx}+D_{s\vu}</m> is the curve which first follows
<m>C_{\vx}</m> from the origin to <m>\vx</m> and then follows <m>D_{s\vu}</m>
from <m>x</m> to <m>\vx+s\vu</m>. We have
<md>
<mrow>
\int_{C_{\vx}+D_{s\vu}}\vF\cdot d\vr
&amp;=\int_{C_{\vx}}\vF\cdot d\vr
+\int_{D_{s\vu}}\vF\cdot d\vr
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\int_{C_{\vx}}\vF\cdot d\vr
+\int_0^1 \vF(\vx+ts\vu)\cdot (s\vu)\,dt
</mrow>
</md>
In the second integral, make the change of variables
<m>\tau=ts</m>, <m>\dee{\tau}=s\dee{t}</m>. This  gives
<me>
\varphi(\vx+s\vu)=\int_{C_{\vx}}\vF\cdot d\vr
+\int_0^s \vF(\vx+\tau\vu)\cdot \vu\,d\tau
</me>
By the fundamental theorem of calculus, applied to the second integral,
<me>
\diff{\ }{s}\varphi(\vx+s\vu)\Big|_{s=0}
=\vF(\vx+s\vu)\cdot \vu\Big|_{s=0}=\vF(\vx)\cdot \vu
</me>
Applying this with <m>\vu=\hi,\ \hj,\ \hk</m> gives us
<me>
\Big(\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x}(\vx)\,,\,
     \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial y}(\vx)\,,\,
     \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial z}(\vx)\Big)
=\big(\vF(\vx)\cdot\hi\,,\,\vF(\vx)\cdot\hj\,,\,\vF(\vx)\cdot\hk\big)
</me>
which is
<me>
\nabla\varphi(\vx)=\vF(\vx)
</me>
as desired.
</p></proof>

<p>
Using this result, we can completely characterize conservative fields on
<m>\bbbr^2</m> and <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_screenConserv">
<statement><p>
Let <m>\vF</m> be a vector field that is defined and has continuous
first order partial derivatives on all of <m>\bbbr^2</m> (or <m>\bbbr^3</m>).
Then <m>\vF</m> is conservative if and only if it passes the screening test
<m>\vnabla\times\vF=\vZero</m>, i.e. is curl free.
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<warning xml:id="warn_screeningB">
<p>
Note that in Theorem <xref ref="thm_screenConserv"/> we are assuming that
<m>\vF</m> passes the screening test on <em>all</em> of <m>\bbbr^2</m> or <m>\bbbr^3</m>.
We have already seen, in Example <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/>,
that if the screening test fails at even a single point, for example
because the vector field is not defined at that point, then <m>\vF</m> need
not be conservative. We'll explore what happens in such cases in the
(optional)  ยง<xref ref="sec_cohomology"/>. We'll see that something can be salvaged.
</p>
</warning>

<proof><title>Proof of Theorem <xref ref="thm_screenConserv"/></title>
<p>
We'll give the proof for the <m>\bbbr^2</m> case. The proof for the <m>\bbbr^3</m> case
is very similar.
We have already seen, in Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>, that if <m>\vF</m>
is conservative, then it passes the screening test and there is nothing more
to do.
</p>

<p>So we now have
to assume that <m>\vF</m> obeys <m>\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}(x,y)
=  \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}(x,y)</m> on <em>all</em> of <m>\bbbr^2</m>
and prove that it is conservative. We'll do so
using the strategy of Example <xref ref="eg_potentialD"/> to find a function
<m>\varphi(x,y)</m>, that obeys
<me>
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y) &amp;= F_1(x,y) \\
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= F_2(x,y)
\end{split}
</me>
The partial derivative <m>\frac{\partial \ }{\partial x}</m> treats <m>y</m>
as a constant. So <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> obeys the first equation
if and only if there is a function <m>\psi(y)</m> with
<me>
\varphi(x,y)
=\int_0^x F_1(X,y)\,\dee{X}
\ +\ \psi(y)
</me>
This <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> will also obey the second equation if and only if
<md>
<mrow>
F_2(x,y)&amp;= \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\frac{\partial \ }{\partial y}\Big(\int_0^x F_1(X,y)\,\dee{X}\ +\ \psi(y)\Big)

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\int_0^x \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}(X,y)\,\dee{X}\ +\ \psi'(y)
</mrow>
</md>
So we have to find a <m>\psi(y)</m> that obeys
<me>
\psi'(y) = F_2(x,y) -
                \int_0^x \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}(X,y)\,\dee{X}
</me>
This looks bad <mdash/> no matter what <m>\psi(y)</m> is, the left hand side is
independent of <m>x</m>, while it looks like the right hand side depends on <m>x</m>.
Fortunately our screening test hypothesis now rides in to the
rescue<fn>or bails us out, or saves our bacon, or <m>\ldots</m></fn>.
(We haven't used it yet, and it has to come in somewhere.)
<md>
<mrow>
F_2(x,y) -  \int_0^x \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}(X,y)\,\dee{X}
&amp;=F_2(x,y) -  \int_0^x \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}(X,y)\,\dee{X}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= F_2(x,y) - F_2(X,y)\Big|_{X=0}^{X=x}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=F_2(0,y)
</mrow>
</md>
In going from the first line to the second line we used
the fundamental theorem of calculus. So choosing
<me>
\psi(y) = \int_0^y F_2(0,Y)\,\dee{Y} +C
</me>
for any constant <m>C</m>, does the trick.
</p></proof>
