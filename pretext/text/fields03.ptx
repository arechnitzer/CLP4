<title>Conservative Vector Fields</title>

<p>Not all vector fields are created equal. In particular, some vector
fields are easier to work with than others. One important class
of vector fields that are relatively easy to work with, at least sometimes,
but that still arise in many applications are <q>conservative vector fields</q>.

The vector field <m>\vF</m> is said to be <term>conservative</term> if there
exists a function <m>\varphi</m> such that <m>\vF = \vnabla\varphi</m>. Then
<m>\varphi</m> is called a <term>potential</term> for <m>\vF</m>. Note that if <m>\varphi</m>
is a potential for <m>\vF</m> and if <m>C</m> is a constant, then <m>\varphi+C</m>

<li> If <m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m> is a conservative field with potential
<m>\varphi</m> and if <m>C</m> is a constant, then the set of points that

Similarly, in two dimensions, the set of points that

we know that our particle can never escape the region

<p>We have already found conservation of energy very helpful
a couple of times in Section <xref ref="sec_Sliding"/> (Sliding on a Curve).
So, at this point, there are probably several questions gnawing away at you.
<ul>
<li>
Is every vector field conservative?
</li>
<li>
If not, is there an easy way to tell whether or not a vector field
is conservative?
</li>
<li>
If we know that a given vector field is conservative, how do find a potential
for it?
</li>
</ul>
Have no fear. We will consider those questions in some detail shortly.
But first, a couple of more examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_fieldlinesPotential">
<p>
In this example we will show that the vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = x\,\hi-y\,\hj</m>
is conservative and find both its potential and its field lines.
<ol label="a">
<li> <em>The potential:</em> Our vector field <m>\vF(x,y) = x\,\hi-y\,\hj</m>

\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= -y
</mrow>
</md>
Recall that, when taking the partial derivative <m>\frac{\partial\ }{\partial x}</m>
the coordinate <m>y</m> is viewed as a constant. So the first of these equations
is satisfied if and only if there is a <m>\psi(y)</m>, which does not depend on <m>x</m>,
so that
<me>
\varphi(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{2} +\psi(y)
</me>
For this to also satisfy the second equation, we need
<md>
<mrow>
-y=\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y)
=\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}\Big(\frac{x^2}{2} +\psi(y)\Big)
=\psi'(y)
</mrow>
</md>
which is the case if and only if there is a constant <m>C</m> with
<me>
\psi(y) =-\frac{y^2}{2} +C
</me>
So, for any choice of the constant <m>C</m>,
<me>
\frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{y^2}{2} +C
</me>
is a potential. In particular, taking <m>C=0</m>, one possible potential is
<me>
\varphi(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{y^2}{2}
</me>
Some equipotential curves for this potential are sketched in (c) below.
They are the blue curves.

<li>

They are the red curves. Note that they appear to cross the equipotential
curves, the blue curves, at right angles. We shall see in
Lemma <xref ref="lem_equipotential"/>, below, that this is not a coincidence.
Also note that, while the above computation tells what the field lines
are, it does not give us the direction of motion along the field lines.
We determine the direction of motion next.

</li>
</ol>
</p></example>

<p>We have just seen one example of a conservative vector field for which the
field lines appear to cross the equipotential curves at right angles.
Here is a result which says that that was no accident. The field lines of
conservative fields always cross the equipotential surfaces
at right angles.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lem_equipotential"><title>Optional</title>
<statement><p>
If <m>\vF</m> is a conservative vector field, then the field lines of <m>\vF</m>
are perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces of <m>\vF</m>.
</p></statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>\vF=\vnabla\varphi</m>.
Pick any point <m>\vr_0</m> and any nonzero vector <m>\vT</m>
that is tangent to the equipotential surface at <m>\vr_0</m>. That
equipotential surface is  <m>\varphi\big(x,y,z\big)=\varphi(\vr_0)</m>.
Consider any curve <m>\vr(t)=\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)</m> that
<ul>
<li>
lies in the equipotential surface of <m>\vF</m> through <m>\vr_0</m>,
so that <m>\varphi\big(\vr(t)\big)=\varphi(\vr_0)</m> for all <m>t</m>,
and also obeys
</li>
<li>
<m>\vr(0)=\vr_0</m> and
</li>
<li>
<m>\diff{\vr}{t}(0) = \vT</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Differentiating <m>\varphi\big(\vr(t)\big)=\varphi(\vr_0)</m>
with respect to <m>t</m> and applying the chain rule gives
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{\ }{t}\big[\varphi\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)\big] &amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
or
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x}\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)\diff{x}{t}(t)
&amp;+\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial y}\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)\diff{y}{t}(t)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;+\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial z}\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)\diff{z}{t}(t)
=0
</mrow>
</md>
Notice that the left hand side is exactly the dot product
of <m>\big(\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x}
\,,\,\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial y}
\,,\,\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial z}\big)=\vnabla\varphi</m>
with
<m>\big(\diff{x}{t}
\,,\,\diff{y}{t}
\,,\,\diff{z}{t}\big)
=\diff{\vr}{t}</m>.
So
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\varphi\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot\diff{\vr}{t}(t) &amp;= 0
</mrow><mrow>
 \vF\big(\vr(t)\big)\cdot\diff{\vr}{t}(t) &amp;= 0
</mrow>
</md>
Then set <m>t=0</m> to get
<me>
 \vF\big(\vr_0\big)\cdot\vT = 0
</me>
This says that the vector <m>\vT</m>, which is tangent to the equipotential
surface at <m>\vr_0</m>, is perpendicular
to the vector field at <m>\vr_0</m>, which is a tangent vector to the
field line of <m>\vF</m> through <m>\vr_0</m>.
</p></proof>

<p>Here is another example in which we try to find a potential for a vector field.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_potentialB">
<p>
Let's try to find a potential for the vortex vector field
<m>\vv(x,y) = \Om\big(-y\hi +x\hj\big)</m> of Example <xref ref="eg_Vortex"/>.
The potential would have to obey
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y) &amp;= -\Om y
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= \Om x
</mrow>
</md>
We proceed just as we did in Example <xref ref="eg_fieldlinesPotential"/>.
The first of these equations is satisfied if and only if there is a
<m>\psi(y)</m>, which does not depend on <m>x</m>, so that
<me>
\varphi(x,y) = -\Om xy +\psi(y)
</me>
For this to also satisfy the second equation, we need
<md>
<mrow>
\Om x=\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y)
=\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}\Big(-\Om xy +\psi(y)\Big)
=-\Om x +\psi'(y)
\iff \psi'(y) = 2\Om x
</mrow>
</md>
If <m>\Om\ne 0</m>, the right hand side of this equation depends on <m>x</m>
while the left hand side in independent of <m>x</m>, no matter what <m>\psi</m> is.
So no <m>\psi</m> can work, and <m>\vv(x,y) = \Om\big(-y\hi +x\hj\big)</m> is not
conservative.
</p></example>


<p>The previous example shows that not all vector fields are conservative.
That answers the first of the questions that we posed just before Example
<xref ref="eg_fieldlinesPotential"/>.
The next theorem provides a simple screening test for conservativeness,
which partially answers the second question. The easy way to remember the
screening test uses the curl, which we now define.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_curl">
<statement><p>
The curl of a vector field <m>\vF(x,y,z)</m> is denoted by <m>\vnabla\times\vF(x,y,z)</m>
and is defined by
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\times\vF
&amp;=\Big(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z} \Big)\hi
+\Big(\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial z} -\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x} \Big)\hj
+\Big(\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} \Big)\hk

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}
                \hi &amp;\hj &amp; \hk \\
                \frac{\partial\ }{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}

                F_1(x,y,z) &amp; F_2(x,y,z) &amp; F_3(x,y,z)
            \end{matrix}\right]
</mrow>
</md>
The determinant in the second row is really just a mnemonic device
used to make it easy to remember the expression after the equals sign
in the first row. One must be careful about the signs in this definition <mdash/>
the determinant helps with that.

<m>\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} =  \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}</m>
Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/> does <em>not</em> guarantee that
<m>\vF</m> is conservative. In fact there are fields that are not conservative
but do obey <m>\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}</m>.
We'll see one in Example <xref ref="eg_screeningCounterexample"/>, below.
We shall later find some additional regularity conditions which, when
combined with <m>\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}</m>,
do imply conservativeness. See Theorem <xref ref="thm_screenConserv"/>, below.

<example xml:id="eg_potentialBB"><title>Example <xref ref="eg_potentialB"/> revisited</title>
<p>
In Example <xref ref="eg_potentialB"/>, we attempted to find a potential
for the vector field
<me>
\vv(x,y) = \Om\big(-y\hi +x\hj\big)
</me>
In the end we showed that, if <m>\Om\ne 0</m>, no potential could exist, i.e.
<m>\vv(x,y)</m> is not conservative. Had we known
the screening test of Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>.a, we could have
concluded that <m>\vv(x,y)</m> is not conservative by simply observing that
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
\frac{\partial \vv_1}{\partial y}&amp;= \frac{\partial \ }{\partial y}\big(-\Om y) &amp;= -\Om
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial \vv_2}{\partial x}&amp;= \ \ \frac{\partial \ }{\partial x}\big(\Om x) &amp;= +\Om

field.

<p>
Let's start by applying the screening test Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>.b.
Since
<md>

                \hi &amp;\hj &amp; \hk

is not <m>\vZero</m>, the vector field <m>\vF</m> cannot be conservative.
</p>
</solution>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_potentialD">

is conservative. If it is conservative, find a potential.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
Again start by applying the screening test Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>.b.
This time
<md>
<mrow>
\vnabla\times\vF
&amp;=\det\left[\begin{matrix}
                \hi &amp;\hj &amp; \hk \\

</md>
So <m>\vF</m> passes the screening test. Let's look for a function
<m>\varphi(x,y,z)</m> obeying
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y,z) &amp;= y^2+2xz^2-1 
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y,z) &amp;= (2x+1)y
\tag{$*$}
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z}(x,y,z) &amp;= 2x^2z+z^3
</mrow>
</md>
The partial derivative <m>\frac{\partial \ }{\partial x}</m> treats <m>y</m>
and <m>z</m> as constants. So <m>\varphi(x,y,z)</m> obeys the first equation
if and only if there is a function <m>\psi(y,z)</m> with
<me>
\varphi(x,y,z)
=xy^2+x^2z^2-x
+\psi(y,z)
</me>
This <m>\varphi(x,y,z)</m> will also obey the second equation if and only if
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\frac{\partial \ }{\partial y}\big(xy^2+x^2z^2-x+\psi(y,z)\big) = (2x+1)y
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff 2xy +\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}(y,z) = (2x+1)y
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}(y,z) = y
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff \psi(y,z) = \frac{y^2}{2} +\zeta(z)
</mrow>
</md>
for some function <m>\zeta(z)</m> which depends only on <m>z</m>. At this stage
we know that
<me>
\varphi(x,y,z)
=xy^2+x^2z^2-x+\psi(y,z)
=xy^2+x^2z^2-x+\frac{y^2}{2}+\zeta(z)
</me>
obeys the first two equations of (<m>*</m>),
for any function <m>\zeta(z)</m>. Finally to have the third equation of
(<m>*</m>) also satisfied, we also need to chose <m>\zeta(z)</m>
to obey
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\frac{\partial \ }{\partial z}\big(xy^2+x^2z^2-x+\frac{y^2}{2}+\zeta(z)\big)
 = 2x^2z+z^3
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff 2x^2z +\zeta'(z) = 2x^2z + z^3
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff \zeta'(z) = z^3
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\hskip1in\iff \zeta(z) = \frac{z^4}{4} + C
</mrow>
</md>
for any constant <m>C</m>. So one possible potential, namely that with <m>C=0</m> is
<me>
\varphi(x,y,z)
=xy^2+x^2z^2-x+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^4}{4}
</me>
Note, as a check<fn>It is always worth doing this check.</fn>, that
<me>
\vnabla \varphi(x,y,z)
=\big(y^2+2xz^2-1\big)\hi+\big(2xy+y)\hj+\big(2x^2z+z^3\big)\hk
</me>
as desired.

<example xml:id="eg_screeningCounterexample"><title>Optional: First look at <m>-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\hi + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\hj</m></title>
<p>
Now is a good time to reread the Warning <xref ref="warn_screening"/>.
In this example we will show that the vector field
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\vF(x,y) = -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\hi + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\hj
</mrow><mrow>&amp;\qquad \text{defined for all $(x,y)$ in $\bbbr^2$ except $(x,y)=(0,0)$}
</mrow>
</md>
passes the screening test of Theorem <xref ref="thm_screen"/>.a. We will also
begin to see why it is <em>not</em> conservative on the domain
<m>\bbbr^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}</m>. To verify the screening test, we compute
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}\Big(-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\Big)
  &amp;= -\frac{(x^2+y^2) - y(2y)}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}
  &amp;&amp;= \frac{y^2-x^2}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial\ }{\partial x}\Big(\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\Big)
  &amp;=\phantom{-} \frac{(x^2+y^2) - x(2x)}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}
  &amp;&amp;= \frac{y^2-x^2}{{(x^2+y^2)}^2}
</mrow>
</md>
and observe that the two right hand sides are identical. So the
screening test is passed.
</p>

<p>In order for <m>\vF</m> to be conservative on the domain
<m>\bbbr^2\setminus\{(0,0\}</m>, there must exist a function
<m>\varphi(x,y)</m>, that, together with both partial derivatives
<m>\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y)</m> and
<m>\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y)</m>, is defined for all <m>(x,y)</m>
in <m>\bbbr^2</m> except <m>(x,y)=(0,0)</m>, and obeys
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y) &amp;= -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}
&amp;&amp;= \frac{-\frac{y}{x^2}}{1+\big(\frac{y}{x}\big)^2}
&amp;&amp;=\frac{\partial\ }{\partial x}\Big(\arctan\frac{y}{x}\Big)
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= \phantom{-} \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}
&amp;&amp;= \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{1+\big(\frac{y}{x}\big)^2}
&amp;&amp;=\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}\Big(\arctan\frac{y}{x}\Big)
</mrow>
</md>
by the chain rule, because
<me>
\frac{\partial\ }{\partial x}\Big(\frac{y}{x}\Big) =-\frac{y}{x^2}
\qquad
\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y}\Big(\frac{y}{x}\Big)=\frac{1}{x}
</me>
It looks like we have found a potential, namely <m>\arctan\frac{y}{x}</m>.
But there is a problem. Recall that, by definition, <m>\arctan\frac{y}{x}</m> is
an angle <m>\theta(x,y)</m> that obeys
<m>\tan\theta(x,y)= \arctan\frac{y}{x}</m>; but for any
<m>(x,y)\in\bbbr^2\setminus\{(0,0\}</m> there are infinitely many angles
having the tangent <m>\frac{y}{x}</m>. To define <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> we have to
select exactly one such angle. It is impossible to do so in such a way
that <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> is continuous on all of <m>\bbbr^2\setminus\{(0,0\}</m>.
</p>

<p>To see why, fix any <m>r \gt 0</m>, and imagine that you are walking on the circle
<m>x^2+y^2=r^2</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane. At time <m>\theta</m>, you are at <m>x=r\cos\theta</m>,
<m>y=r\sin\theta</m> and then <m>\frac{y}{x} = \tan\theta</m> and you are allowed to
define <m>\varphi(x,y)=\theta+k\pi</m>, for any integer <m>k</m>.
</p>

<p> Suppose that at time <m>\theta=0</m> you choose <m>k=0</m>. That is, you choose <m>\varphi(r,0)=0</m>.
Now start walking, choosing an allowed <m>\varphi(x,y)</m>, i.e. choosing a <m>k</m>,
for each point <m>(x,y)</m> that you cross.
Because <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> has to vary continuously<fn>If <m>\varphi(x,y)</m>
is not continuous, its gradient does not exist, and <m>\varphi</m> cannot be
a potential.</fn>
 with <m>(x,y)</m>, you
have to continue choosing <m>k=0</m>. But you run off a cliff as <m>\theta</m>
approaches <m>2\pi</m>, because then
<ul>
<li>
you are approaching <m>(r,0)</m> from below, as in the figure below, and
</li>
<li>
because you are choosing <m>k=0</m>, <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> is just a little less than
<m>2\pi</m>, but
</li>
<li>
you have already chosen <m>\varphi(r,0)=0</m>, not <m>2\pi</m>.
So <m>\varphi(x,y)</m> has a jump discontinuity<fn>Those who have taken
some complex analysis may recognize this as the branch cut in <m>\ln z</m>.</fn>
along the positive <m>x</m>-axis.
</li>
</ul>
