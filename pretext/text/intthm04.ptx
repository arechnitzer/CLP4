<title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
<introduction>

<p>Our last variant of the fundamental theorem of calculus is
Stokes'<fn>Sir George Gabriel Stokes (1819<ndash/>1903) was an Irish physicist and mathematician. In addition to Stokes' theorem, he is known for the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and for his work on the wave theory of light. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in
Railway Structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.
</fn> theorem, which is like Green's theorem, but in three dimensions.
It relates an integral over a finite surface
in <m>\bbbr^3</m> with an integral over the curve bounding the surface.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_Stokes"><title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
<statement><p>
Let
<ul>
<li>
<m>S</m> be a piecewise smooth oriented surface (i.e. a unit normal <m>\hn</m> has
been chosen at each point of <m>S</m> and this choice depends continuously
on the point)
</li>
<li><p>
the boundary, <m>\partial S</m>, of the surface <m>S</m> consist of a finite number of piecewise smooth, simple curves that are oriented consistently with <m>\hn</m> in the sense that
<ul>
<li>
    if you walk along <m>\partial S</m> in the direction of the arrow
    on <m>\partial S</m>,
</li>
<li>
     with the vector from your feet to your head  having direction <m>\hn</m>
</li>
<li>
    then <m>S</m> is on your left hand side.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<sidebyside width="41%">
<image source="figs/stokes0"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li>
<m>\vF</m> be a vector field that has continuous first partial derivatives
at every point of <m>S</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Then
<me>
\oint_{\partial S}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
  =\dblInt_{S}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
</me>
</p>

</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Note that
<ul>
<li>
in Stokes' theorem, <m>S</m> must be an oriented surface. In particular, <m>S</m> may not be a Möbius strip. (See Example <xref ref="eg_orientMobius"/>.)
</li>
<li>
If <m>S</m> is part of the <m>xy</m>-plane, then Stokes' theorem reduces to Green's
theorem. Our proof of Stokes' theorem will consist of rewriting the integrals
so as to allow an application of Green's theorem.
</li>
<li>
<p>
If <m>\partial S</m> is a simple closed curve and
<ul>
<li>
when you look at <m>\partial S</m> from high on the <m>z</m>-axis, it is oriented
counterclockwise (look at the figure in Theorem <xref ref="thm_Stokes"/>), then
</li>
<li>
<m>\hn</m> is upward pointing, i.e. has positive <m>z</m>-component, at least near
<m>\partial S</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<proof>
<p>
Write <m>\vF=F_1\,\hi+F_2\,\hj+F_3\,\hk</m>.
Both integrals involve <m>F_1</m> terms and <m>F_2</m> terms and
<m>F_3</m> terms. We shall show that the <m>F_1</m> terms in the two integrals agree.
In other words, we shall assume that <m>\vF=F_1\hi</m>.
The proofs that the <m>F_2</m> and <m>F_3</m> terms also agree are similar.
For simplicity, we'll assume<fn>Otherwise, decompose <m>S</m> into simpler pieces, analogously to what we did in the proof of the divergence theorem.</fn>
that the boundary of <m>S</m> consists of just a single curve, and that we can
<ul>
<li>
pick a parametrization of <m>S</m> with
<me>
S=\Set{\vr(u,v)=\big(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)\big)}{ (u,v)\text{ in }
                 R\subset\bbbr^2}
</me>
and with <m>\vr(u,v)</m> orientation preserving in the sense that
<m>\hn\,\dee{S} = +\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}
\times \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}\,\dee{u}\,\dee{v}</m>. Also
</li>
<li>  pick a parametrization of the curve, <m>\partial R</m>, bounding <m>R</m> as
<m>\big( u(t), v(t)\big)</m>, <m>a\le t\le b</m>, in such a way that
when you walk along <m>\partial R</m> in the direction of increasing <m>t</m>, then <m>R</m>
is on your left.
</li>
</ul>
Then the curve <m>\partial S</m> bounding <m>S</m>
can be parametrized as <m>\vR(t)=\vr\big(u(t),v(t)\big)</m>, <m>a\le t\le b</m>.

</sidebyside>

<p>
<em>The orientation of <m>\vR(t)</m>:</em>
</p>

<p>We'll now verify that the direction of increasing <m>t</m> for the parametrization
<m>\vR(t)</m> of <m>\partial S</m> is the direction of the arrow on <m>\partial S</m>
in the figure on the left above.
</p>

<p>By continuity, it suffices to check the orientation at a single point.
</p>

<p>Find a point <m>(u_0,v_0)</m> on <m>\partial R</m> where the forward pointing
tangent vector is a positive multiple of <m>\,\hi</m>. The horizontal
arrow on <m>\partial R</m>
in the figure on the left below is at such a point. Suppose that
<m>t=t_0</m> at this point <mdash/> in other words, suppose
that <m>(u_0,v_0)=\big(u(t_0),v(t_0)\big)</m>.
Because  the forward pointing tangent vector to <m>\partial R</m> at
<m>(u_0,v_0)</m>, namely <m>\big(u'(t_0),v'(t_0)\big)</m>,
 is a positive multiple of <m>\,\hi</m>, we have <m>u'(t_0) \gt 0</m> and
<m>v'(t_0)=0</m>.
The tangent vector to <m>\partial S</m> at <m> \vR(t_0)=\vr\big(u_0,v_0\big)</m>,
pointing in the direction of increasing <m>t</m>, is
<md>
<mrow>
\vR'(t_0)&amp;=\diff{ }{t}\vr\big(u(t),v(t)\big)\big|_{t=t_0}
=u'(t_0)\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}(u_0,v_0)
+v'(t_0) \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}(u_0,v_0)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=u'(t_0)\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}(u_0,v_0)
</mrow>
</md>
and so is a positive multiple of <m>\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}(u_0,v_0)</m>.
See the figure on the right below.
</p>

<p>If we now walk along a path in the <m>uv</m>-plane which starts at <m>(u_0,v_0)</m>,
holds <m>u</m> fixed at <m>u_0</m> and increases <m>v</m>, we move into the interior of
<m>R</m> starting at <m>(u_0,v_0)</m>. Correspondingly, if we walk along the path,
<m>\vr(u_0,v)</m>, in <m>\bbbr^3</m> with <m>v</m> starting at <m>v_0</m> and increasing,
we move into the interior of <m>S</m>. The forward tangent to this new path,
<m>\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}(u_0,v_0)</m>,
points from <m> \vr(u_0,v_0)</m> into the interior of <m>S</m>. It's the blue arrow in
the figure on the right below.
</p>

</sidebyside>

<p>Now imagine that you are walking along <m>\partial S</m> in the direction of
increasing <m>t</m>. At time <m>t_0</m> you are at <m>\vR(t_0)</m>. You point your right arm
straight ahead of you. So it is pointing in the direction
<m>\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}(u_0,v_0)</m>. You point your left arm
out sideways into the interior of <m>S</m>. It is pointing in the
direction <m>\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}(u_0,v_0)</m>. If the direction
of increasing <m>t</m> is the same as the forward direction of the orientation
of <m>\partial S</m>, then the vector from our feet to our head, which is
<m>\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}(u_0,v_0)
\times \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}(u_0,v_0)</m>, should be pointing in
the same direction as <m>\hn</m>. And since
<m>\hn\,\dee{S} = +\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial u}
     \times \frac{\partial \vr}{\partial v}\,\dee{u}\,\dee{v}</m>, it is.
</p>

<p>Now, with our parametrization and orientation sorted out, we can examine
the integrals.

</p></proof>


<p>Before we move on to some examples, here are a couple of remarks.<ul>
<li><p>
Stokes' theorem says that
<m>\oint_{C}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}
  =\dblInt_{S}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}</m>
for any (suitably oriented) surface whose boundary is <m>C</m>. So if
<m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m> are two different (suitably oriented) surfaces having the
same boundary curve <m>C</m>, then
<me>
\dblInt_{S_1}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
=\dblInt_{S_2}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
</me>
For example, if <m>C</m> is the unit circle
<me>
C=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2=1,\ z=0}
</me>
oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, then both
<md>
<mrow>
S_1&amp;= \Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2\le 1,\ z=0}
</mrow><mrow>
S_2&amp;= \Set{(x,y,z)}{z\ge0,\ x^2+y^2+z^2=1}
</mrow>
</md>
with upward pointing unit normal vectors, have boundary <m>C</m>. So Stokes'
tells us that <m>\dblInt_{S_1}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
=\dblInt_{S_2}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="26%">
<image source="figs/twoSurfaceA"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
It should not be a surprise that <m>\dblInt_{S_1}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
=\dblInt_{S_2}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}</m>, for the following reason.
Let
<me>
V= \Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1,\ z\ge 0} \\
</me>
be the solid between <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>.
The boundary <m>\partial V</m> of <m>V</m> is the union of <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="26%">
<image source="figs/twoSurfaceB"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
But beware that the outward pointing normal to <m>\partial V</m> (call it
<m>\hN</m>) is <m>+\hn</m> on <m>S_2</m> and <m>-\hn</m> on <m>S_1</m>. So the divergence
theorem gives
<md>
<mrow>
&amp;\dblInt_{S_2}\vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}

by the vector identity Theorem <xref ref="thm_degTwoIdentities"/>.a.
</p></li>
<li><p>
As a second remark, suppose that the vector field <m>\vF</m> obeys <m>\vnabla\times\vF=\vZero</m> everywhere. Then Stokes' theorem forces
<m>\oint_{C}\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}=0</m> are around all closed curves <m>C</m>,
which implies that <m>\vF</m> is conservative, by
Theorem <xref ref="thm_pathIndepConserv"/>. So Stokes' theorem provides
another proof of Theorem <xref ref="thm_screenConserv"/>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Here is an easy example which shows that Stokes' can be very useful
when <m>\vnabla\times\vF</m> simplifies.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_stokesAA">
<statement><p>
Evaluate

and the curve <m>C</m> is the circle <m>x^2+y^2=4</m>, <m>z=1</m>,
oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>The <m>x^{146}</m> in <m>\vF</m> will probably make a direct evaluation of the
integral difficult. So we'll use Stokes' theorem. To do so we need
a surface <m>S</m> with <m>\partial S=C</m>. The simplest is just the flat
disk

The <m>x^{146}</m> in <m>\vF</m> will probably make a direct evaluation of the

a surface <m>S</m> with <m>\partial S=C</m>. The simplest is the flat

S = \Set{(x,y,z)}{ x^2+y^2+z^2\le 4,\ \ z=y}

<p>We'll evaluate the integral <m>2\dblInt_S \hj\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}</m> in two ways.
The first way is more efficient, but also requires more insight.
Since <m>\vnabla(z-y)=\hk-\hj</m>, the upward unit normal to the plane <m>z-y=0</m>,
and hence to <m>S</m>, is <m>\hn = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hk-\hj)</m>.
Consequently the integrand
<md>
<mrow>
\hj\cdot\hn=\hj\cdot\Big(\frac{-\hj+\hk}{\sqrt{2}}\Big)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}

is a constant and we do not need a formula for <m>\hn\,dS</m>:

<p>Alternatively, we can evaluate the integral <m>\dblInt_S \hj\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}</m>

To get the upward pointing normal pointing normal, we take the <m>+</m> sign

The curve <m>C</m> is a triangle and so is contained in a plane.
Any plane has an equation of the form <m>Ax+By+Cz=D</m>.
Our plane does not pass through the origin (look at the figure above)
so the <m>D</m> must be nonzero. Consequently we may divide <m>Ax+By+Cz=D</m> through
by <m>D</m> giving an equation of the form <m>ax+by+cz=1</m>.
<ul>
<li>  Because <m>(2,0,0)</m> lies on the plane, <m>a=\frac{1}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li>  Because <m>(0,3,0)</m> lies on the plane, <m>b=\frac{1}{3}</m>.
</li>
<li>  Because <m>(0,0,6)</m> lies on the plane, <m>c=\frac{1}{6}</m>.

So the triangle is contained in the plane <m>\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{3}+\frac{z}{6}=1</m>.

<solution>
<p>First, let's sketch the curve.
<m>x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}=1</m> is an ellipsoid centred on the
origin and <m>z=x^2+2y^2</m> is an upward opening paraboloid that passes
through the origin. They are sketched in the figure below.
The paraboloid is red.

<sidebyside width="60%">

<p>
Their intersection, the curve <m>C</m>, is the blue curve in the figure.
It looks like a deformed<fn>By Salvador Dali?</fn> circle.
</p>

<p>One could imagine parametrizing <m>C</m>. For example, substituting
<m>x^2 = z - 2y^2</m> into the equation of the ellipsoid gives
<m>-\frac{3}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{3}(z+\frac{3}{2}\big)^2 = \frac{7}{4}</m>.
This can be solved to give <m>y</m> as a function of <m>z</m> and then
<m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> also gives <m>x</m> as a function of <m>z</m>. However this would
clearly yield, at best, a really messy integral. So let's try
Stokes' theorem.

only simple thing about it is that its boundary, <m>\partial S</m>, is the circle

It is clear that we should not try to evaluate the integral
directly<fn>That way lies pain.</fn>.
In this solution we will combine the divergence theorem with the
observation that
<md>

\vnabla\cdot\vG = \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(2x)+
                  \frac{\partial }{\partial y}(2z-2x)+

                =0
</mrow>
</md>
to avoid ever having work with the surface <m>S</m>. Here is an outline of
what we will do.
<ul>
<li>
We first select a simple surface <m>S'</m> whose boundary <m>\partial S'</m> is also
the circle <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, <m>z=0</m>. A nice simple choice of <m>S'</m>, and the surface that we will use, is the disk
<me>
S' =\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2=1,\ z=0}
</me>
</li>
<li><p>
Then we define <m>V</m> to be the solid whose top surface is <m>S</m> and
whose bottom surface is <m>S'</m>. So the boundary of <m>V</m> is the union of <m>S</m> and
<m>S'</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="30%">
<image source="figs/stokes7a"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li>
For <m>S'</m>, we will use the upward pointing normal <m>\hn=\hk</m>,
which is <em>minus</em> the outward pointing normal to <m>\partial V</m>
on <m>S'</m>. So the divergence theorem says that
<me>
\tripInt_V \vnabla\cdot\vG\,\dee{V}
=\dblInt_S\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}-\dblInt_{S'}\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
</me>
The left hand side is zero because, as we have already seen,
<m>\vnabla\cdot\vG=0</m>. So
<me>
\dblInt_S\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
=\dblInt_{S'}\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
</me>
</li>
<li>  Finally, we compute <m>\dblInt_{S'}\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
We saw an argument like this (with <m>\vG=\vnabla\times\vF</m>)
in the first remark following the proof of
Theorem <xref ref="thm_Stokes"/>.
</p>

<p>So all that we have to do now is compute

\dblInt_S\vG\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}

</md>
simply because the integrand is odd under <m>x\rightarrow-x</m>.
</p>
</solution>

<solution>
<p>
In this second solution we'll use Stokes' theorem instead of
the divergence theorem. To do so, we have to express <m>\vG</m> in the form
<m>\vnabla\times\vF</m>. So the first thing to do is to check if <m>\vG</m>
passes the screening test, Theorem <xref ref="thm_screenVector"/>, for the existence
of vector potentials. That is, to check if <m>\vnabla\cdot\vG=0</m>. It is.
We saw this in Solution 1 above.
</p>

<p>Next, we have to find a vector potential.
In fact, we have already found, in Example <xref ref="eg_vectorPotentialB"/>, that
<me>
\vF = (z^2-2xz) \hi +(x^2-2xz)\hj
</me>
is a vector potential for <m>\vG</m>, which we can quickly check.

<p><em>Direct Computation:</em></p>

<p>
In this first computation, we parametrize the curve <m>C</m> and compute
<m>\oint_C\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}</m> directly. The plane <m>z=y</m> passes through the origin,
which is the centre of the sphere <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=4</m>.
So <m>C</m> is a circle which, like the sphere, has radius <m>2</m> and centre
<m>(0,0,0)</m>. We use a parametrization of the form
<me>
\vr(t)=\vc+\rho\cos t\,\hi'+ \rho\sin t\,\hj'
\qquad 0\le t\le 2\pi
</me>
where
 <ul>
<li>
      <m>\vc=(0,0,0)</m> is the centre of <m>C</m>,
</li>
<li>
      <m>\rho=2</m> is the radius of <m>C</m> and
</li>
<li><p>
<m>\hi'</m> and <m>\hj'</m> are two vectors that
<ol label="a">
<li> are unit vectors,
</li>
<li> are parallel to the plane <m>z=y</m> and
</li>
<li> are mutually perpendicular.
</li>
</ol></p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<sidebyside width="38%">
<image source="figs/circle4a"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
The trickiest part is finding suitable vectors <m>\hi'</m> and <m>\hj'</m>:
<ul>
<li>
     The point <m>(2,0,0)</m> satisfies both  <m>x^2+y^2+z^2=4</m> and <m>z=y</m> and
     so is on <m>C</m>. We may choose <m>\hi'</m> to be the unit vector in the
     direction from the centre <m>(0,0,0)</m> of the circle towards <m>(2,0,0)</m>.
     Namely <m>\hi'=(1,0,0)</m>.
</li>
<li>
     Since the plane of the circle is <m>z-y=0</m>, the
     vector <m>\vnabla(z-y)=(0,-1,1)</m> is perpendicular to the plane of
     <m>C</m>. So  <m>\hk'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,-1,1)</m> is a unit vector normal
     to <m>z=y</m>. Then
      <m>\hj'=\hk'\times\hi'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,-1,1)\times(1,0,0)
      =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,1,1)</m> is a unit vector that is
      perpendicular to <m>\hi'</m> and <m>\hk'</m>.
     Since <m>\hj'</m> is perpendicular to <m>\hk'</m>, it is parallel to <m>z=y</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Substituting in <m>\vc=(0,0,0)</m>, <m>\rho=2</m>, <m>\hi'=(1,0,0)</m> and
<m>\hj'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,1,1)</m> gives

</mrow><mrow>
&amp;0\le t\le 2\pi
</mrow>
</md>
To check that this parametrization is correct, note that
<m>x=2\cos t</m>, <m>y=\sqrt{2}\sin t</m>, <m>z=\sqrt{2}\sin t</m> satisfies both
<m>x^2+y^2+z^2=4</m> and <m>z=y</m>.
</p>

<p>At <m>t=0</m>, <m>\vr(0)=(2,0,0)</m>. As <m>t</m> increases,
<m>z(t)=\sqrt{2}\sin t</m> increases and <m>\vr(t)</m> moves upwards towards
<m>\vr\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big)=(0,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})</m>.
This is the desired counterclockwise direction (when viewed from above). Now that we have a
parametrization, we can set up the integral.

The integration variables are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and, by definition,
the domain of integration is
<me>
R=\Set{(x,y)}{(x,y,z)\text{ is in }S\text{ for some }z}
</me>
To determine precisely what this domain of integration is, we observe that
since <m>z=y</m> on <m>S</m>, <m>x^2+y^2+z^2\le 4</m> is the same as <m>x^2+2y^2\le 4</m> on <m>S</m>,
<me>
S=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+2y^2\le 4,\ z=y}
\implies R=\Set{(x,y)}{x^2+2y^2\le 4}
</me>
So the domain of integration is an ellipse with semimajor axis <m>a=2</m>,
semiminor axis <m>b=\sqrt{2}</m> and area <m>\pi a b=2\sqrt{2}\pi</m>. The integral is then
<me>

</p>

<p><em>Remark (Limits of integration):</em>
</p>

<p>
If the integrand were more complicated, we would have to evaluate the integral
over <m>R</m> by expressing it as an iterated integrals with the correct limits
of integration. First suppose that we slice up <m>R</m> using thin vertical
slices. On each such slice, <m>x</m> is essentially constant and <m>y</m> runs from
<m>-\sqrt{(4-x^2)/2}</m> to <m>\sqrt{(4-x^2)/2}</m>.  The leftmost such slice would
have <m>x=-2</m> and the rightmost such slice would have <m>x=2</m>. So the correct
limits with this slicing are
<me>
\dblInt_R f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\dee{y}
=\int_{-2}^2\dee{x}\int_{-\sqrt{(4-x^2)/2}}^{\sqrt{(4-x^2)/2}} \dee{y}\ f(x,y)
</me>
</p>

<sidebyside width="40%">
  <image source="figs/limitsv"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
If, instead, we slice up <m>R</m> using thin horizontal
slices, then, on each such slice, <m>y</m> is essentially constant and <m>x</m> runs from
<m>-\sqrt{4-2y^2}</m> to <m>\sqrt{4-2y^2}</m>.  The bottom such slice would
have <m>y=-\sqrt{2}</m> and the top such slice would have <m>y=\sqrt{2}</m>.
So the correct limits with this slicing are
<me>
\dblInt_R f(x,y)\,\dee{x}\dee{y}
=\int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}\dee{y}\int_{-\sqrt{4-2y^2}}^{\sqrt{4-2y^2}} \dee{x}\ f(x,y)
</me>
</p>

\int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}\dee{y}\int_{-2}^{2} \dee{x}\ f(x,y)

<p>
corresponds to a slicing with <m>x</m> running from <m>-2</m> to <m>2</m> on {\bf every} slice.
This corresponds to a rectangular domain of integration, not what we have here.
</p>

<p>
<em>Stokes' Theorem, Again:</em>
</p>

<p>
Since the integrand is just a constant (after Stoking <mdash/> not the original integrand) and <m>S</m> is so simple (because we chose it wisely), we can evaluate
the integral <m>\dblInt_S \vnabla\times\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}</m> without ever determining
<m>\dee{S}</m> explicitly and without ever setting up any limits of integration.
We already know that <m>\vnabla\times\vF=2\,\hj</m>. Since <m>S</m> is the level
surface <m>z-y=0</m>, the gradient <m>\vnabla(z-y)=-\hj+\hk</m> is normal to <m>S</m>.
So <m>\hn = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-\hj+\hk)</m> and

Of course we are really making an approximation
here, based on the assumption that <m>\vv(x,y,z)</m> is continuous and so
takes values very close to <m>\vv(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> everywhere on the

<p>To measure the circulation
experimentally,
place a small paddle wheel in the fluid, with the axle of the paddle wheel
pointing along <m>\hn</m> and each of the paddles perpendicular to <m>C_\veps</m>
and  centred on <m>C_\veps</m>.
</p>

<p>
Each paddle moves tangentially to <m>C_\veps</m>. It would like to move with
the same speed as the tangential speed <m>\vv\cdot\hvt</m> (where <m>\hvt</m> is the
forward pointing unit tangent vector to <m>C_\veps</m> at the location of the
paddle) of the fluid at its location. But all paddles are rigidly fixed
to the axle of the paddle wheel and so must all move with the same speed.
That common speed will be the average value of <m>\vv\cdot\hvt</m> around <m>C_\veps</m>.
If <m>\dee{s}</m> represents an element of arc length of <m>C_\veps</m>,
the average value of <m>\vv\cdot\hvt</m> around <m>C_\veps</m> is
<me>
\overline{v_T}=\frac{1}{2\pi\veps}\oint_{C_\veps} \vv\cdot \hvt\ \dee{s}
=\frac{1}{2\pi\veps}\oint_{C_\veps} \vv\cdot \dee{\vr}
</me>
since <m>\dee{\vr}</m> has direction <m>\hvt</m> and length <m>\dee{s}</m>
so that <m>\dee{\vr} =\hvt \dee{s}</m>, and since <m>2\pi\veps</m> is the circumference of <m>C_\veps</m>.
If the paddle wheel rotates at <m>\Om</m> radians per unit time, each paddle
travels a distance <m>\Om\veps</m> per unit time
(remember that <m>\veps</m> is the radius of <m>C_\veps</m>). That is, <m>\overline{v_T}=\Om\veps</m>. Combining all this information,

The component of <m>\vnabla\times\!\vv(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> in any direction
<m>\hn</m> is twice the rate at which the paddle wheel turns when it is put
into the fluid at  <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> with its axle pointing in the
direction <m>\hn</m>. The direction
of <m>\vnabla\times\!\vv(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> is the axle direction which gives
maximum rate of rotation and the magnitude of
<m>\vnabla\times\!\vv(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>
is twice that maximum rate of rotation. For this reason,
<m>\vnabla\times \vv</m> is called the <q>vorticity</q>.

  <title>Optional <mdash/> An Application of Stokes' Theorem <mdash/> Faraday's Law</title>

<p>Magnetic induction refers to a physical process whereby an electric
voltage is created (<q>induced</q>) by a time varying magnetic field.
This process is exploited in many applications, including
electric generators, induction motors, induction cooking, induction welding
and inductive charging.
Michael Faraday<fn>Michael Faraday (1791<ndash/>1867) was an
English physicist and chemist. He ended up being an extremely
influential scientist despite having only the most basic of formal educations.</fn> is generally credited with the
discovery of magnetic induction. Faraday's law
is the following. Let <m>S</m> be an oriented surface with boundary <m>C</m>.
Let <m>\vE</m> and <m>\vB</m> be the (time dependent) electric and magnetic
fields and define

\dblInt_S\vB\cdot \hn \,\dee{S}&amp;=\text{magnetic flux through }S
</mrow>
</md></p>

</sidebyside>

<p>
Then the voltage around <m>C</m> is the negative of the rate of change of the
magnetic flux through <m>S</m>. As an equation, Faraday's Law is
<me>
\oint_C\vE\cdot \dee{\vr}=-\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\dblInt_S\vB\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
</me>
We can reformulate this as a partial differential equation.
By Stokes' Theorem,
<me>
\oint_C\vE\cdot \dee{\vr}=\dblInt_S(\vnabla\times\vE)\cdot \hn\,\dee{S}
</me>
so Faraday's law becomes
<me>
\dblInt_S\Big(\vnabla\times\vE+\frac{\partial\vB}{\partial t}\Big)\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}=0
</me>
This is true for all surfaces <m>S</m>. So the integrand, assuming that it is
continuous,  must be zero.
</p>

<p>To see this, let
<m>\vG=\Big(\vnabla\times\vE+\frac{\partial\vB}{\partial t}\Big)</m>.
Suppose that <m>\vG(\vx_0)\ne 0</m>. Pick a unit vector <m>\hn</m> in the direction
of <m>\vG(\vx_0)</m>. Let <m>S</m> be a very small flat disk centered on <m>\vx_0</m>
with normal <m>\hn</m> (the vector we picked). Then <m>\vG(\vx_0)\cdot\hn \gt 0</m>
and, by continuity, <m>\vG(\vx)\cdot\hn \gt 0</m> for all <m>\vx</m> on <m>S</m>, if we have
picked <m>S</m> small enough.
 Then <m>\dblInt_S\Big(\vnabla\times\vE+\frac{\partial\vB}{\partial t}\Big)\cdot \hn\,\dee{S} \gt 0</m>, which is a contradiction.
So <m>\vG=\vZero</m> everywhere and we conclude that
<me>
\vnabla\times\vE+\frac{\partial\vB}{\partial t}=0
</me>
This is one of Maxwell's electromagnetic field equations<fn>For the others, see Example <xref ref="eg_ITmaxwell"/></fn>.
