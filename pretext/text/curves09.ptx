<title>Optional <mdash/> Central Forces</title>



<p>One of the great triumphs of Newtonian mechanics was the explanation
of Kepler's laws<fn>The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571<ndash/>1630)
developed these laws during the course of an attempt to relate the five extraterrestrial planets then known to the five Platonic solids. He based
the laws on a great number of careful measurements
made by the Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546<ndash/>1601). Then
Isaac Newton (English, 1642<ndash/>1727) provided the explanation in 1687.
Kepler also wrote a paper entitled <q>On the Six-Cornered Snowflake</q>.
Tycho Brahe lost his nose in a sword duel and wore a prosthetic nose
from then on. The story is that Brahe died from a burst bladder that resulted
from his refusing to leave the dinner table before his host.</fn>, which said
<ol>
<li>
The planets trace out ellipses about the sun as focus.
</li>
<li>
The radius vector <m>\vr</m> sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
</li>
<li>
The square of the period of each planet is proportional to the cube of the major axis of the planet's orbit.
</li>
</ol>
Newton showed that all of these behaviours follow from the assumption
that the acceleration <m>\va(t)</m> of each planet  obeys the law of
motion <m>m\va =\vF</m> where <m>m</m> is the mass of the planet and
<me>
\vF = -\frac{GMm}{r^3}\vr
</me>
is the <q>gravitational force</q> applied on the planet by the sun. Here
<m>G</m> is a constant<fn>Its value is about <m>6.67408\times10^{-11} \text{m}^3\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{sec}^{-2}</m>.</fn>,
called the <q>gravitational constant</q> or the
<q>universal gravitational constant</q>, <m>M</m> is the mass of the
sun, <m>\vr</m> is the vector from the sun to the planet and <m>r=|\vr|</m>.
</p>

<p>In this section, we'll show that some of these properties follow from the
weaker assumption that the acceleration <m>\va(t)</m> of each planet
obeys the law of motion <m>m\va =\vF</m> with <m>\vF</m> being a central force.
That is, the assumption that <m>\vF</m> is parallel to <m>\vr</m>. The verification that
the other properties follow from the specific form of the gravitational
force, proportional to <m>r^{-2}</m>, will be delayed until the
optional ยง<xref ref="sec_planet"/>.
</p>

<p>So, in this section, we assume that we have a parametrized curve <m>\vr(t)</m> and that this curve obeys
<me>
m\difftwo{\vr}{t}(t) = \vF\big(\vr(t)\big)
</me>
where, for all <m>\vr\in\bbbr^3</m>, <m>\vF(\vr)</m> is parallel to <m>\vr</m>. We shall show that
<ol>
<li>
The path <m>\vr(t)</m> lies in a plane through the origin and that
</li>
<li>
the radius vector <m>\vr</m> sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
</li>
</ol>
We'll start by trying to guess what the plane is. Pretend that we know that
<m>\vr(t)</m> lies in a fixed plane through the origin. Then
<m>\vv(t)=\diff{\vr}{t}(t)</m> lies in the same plane and
<m>\vr(t)\times\vv(t)</m> is perpendicular to the plane. If our path really does
lie in a fixed plane, <m>\vr(t)\times\vv(t)</m> cannot change direction <mdash/> it must
always be parallel to the normal vector to the plane. So let's define
<me>
\vOm(t) = \vr(t)\times\vv(t)
</me>
and check how it depends on time. By the product rule,
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{\vOm}{t}(t) &amp;=\diff{\ }{t}\big(\vr(t)\times\vv(t)\big)
=\vv(t)\times\vv(t) + \vr(t)\times\va(t)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\frac{1}{m}\vr(t)\times\vF\big(\vr(t)\big)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\vZero
\tag{A}
</mrow>
</md>
because <m>\vr(t)</m> and <m>\vF\big(\vr(t)\big)</m> are parallel.
So <m>\vOm(t)</m> is<fn>Physicists call <m>m\,\vOm(t)</m> the angular momentum at time <m>t</m> and refer to (A) as (an example of) conservation of angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum is exploited in gyro-compasses and by ice skaters (to spin faster/slower).</fn>
in fact independent of <m>t</m>. It is a constant vector that we'll just denote <m>\vOm</m>.
</p>

<p>As <m>\vr(t)\times\vv(t)=\vOm</m>, we have that
<m>\vr(t)</m> is always perpendicular to <m>\vOm</m> and
<me>
\vr(t)\cdot\vOm =0
</me>
<ul>
<li>
If <m>\vOm\ne \vZero</m>, this is exactly the statement that <m>\vr(t)</m> always
lies in the plane through the origin with normal vector <m>\vOm</m>.
</li>
<li>
If <m>\vOm=\vZero</m>, then <m>\vr(t)</m> is always parallel to <m>\vv(t)</m> and there
is some function <m>\alpha(t)</m> such that
<me>
\diff{\vr}{t}(t) = \vv(t) = \alpha(t)\,\vr(t)
</me>
This is a first order, linear, ordinary differential equation that we can solve
by using an integrating factor. Set
<me>
\beta(t) = \int_0^t\alpha(t)\ \dee{t}
</me>
Then
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{\vr}{t}(t) = \alpha(t)\,\vr(t)
&amp;\iff e^{-\beta(t)} \diff{\vr}{t}(t) -\alpha(t)e^{-\beta(t)}\,\vr(t)=0
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff \diff{\ }{t}\big[e^{-\beta(t)}\vr(t)\big] = 0
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff e^{-\beta(t)}\vr(t) = \vr(0)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\iff \vr(t) =  e^{\beta(t)}\vr(0)
</mrow>
</md>
so that <m>\vr(t)</m> lies on a line through the origin. This makes sense <mdash/>
the particle is always moving parallel to its radius vector.
</li>
</ul>
This completes the verification that <m>\vr(t)</m> lies in a plane through
the origin.
</p>

<p>Now we show that the radius vector <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out equal areas in
equal times. In other words, we now verify that the rate at which
<m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out area is independent of time. To do so we rewrite the
statement that <m>|\vr(t)\times\vv(t)\big|</m> is constant in polar coordinates.
Writing <m>\vr(t) = r(t)\hat\vr\big(\theta(t)\big)</m> and then applying
Lemma <xref ref="lem_polar"/>.b gives that
<md>
<mrow>
\text{constant} = \big|\vr\times\vv\big|
   &amp;= \Big|r\hat\vr\times\Big(\diff{r}{t}\ \hat\vr
             + r\ \diff{\theta}{t}\ \hat\vth\Big)\Big|
   =r^2\diff{\theta}{t}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\text{since}\quad |\hat\vr\times\hat\vr|=0,\
                        |\hat\vr\times\hat\vth|=1
</mrow>
</md>
is constant. It now suffices to observe that <m>r(t)^2\diff{\theta}{t}(t)</m>
is exactly twice the rate at which <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out area. To see this,
just look at the figure below. The shaded area is essentially a wedge of
a circular disk of radius <m>r</m>. (If <m>r(t)</m> were independent of <m>t</m>, it would be exactly a wedge of a circular disk.) Its area is the
fraction <m>\frac{\dee{\theta}}{2\pi}</m> of the area of the full disk, which is
