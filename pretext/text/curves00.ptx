<title>Curves</title>
<introduction>
  <p>We are now going to study vector-valued functions of one real variable.
  That is, we are going to study functions that assign to each real
  number <m>t</m> (typically in some interval) a vector<fn>We are going to use
  boldface letters, like <m>\vr</m>, to designate vectors. When writing by hand,
  it is clearer to use arrows, like <m>\vec r</m>, instead.</fn>
  <m>\vr(t)</m>. For example
  <me>
  \vr(t) = \big( x(t), y(t), z(t)\big)
  </me>
  might be the position of a particle at time <m>t</m>. As <m>t</m> varies,
  <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out a curve.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="40%">
  <image source="figs/parCurve"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  While in some applications <m>t</m> will indeed be <q>time</q>, it does not
  have to be. It can be simply a parameter that is used to label the
  different points on the curve that <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out. We then say
  that <m>\vr(t)</m> provides a parameterization of the curve.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="eg_paramCircle"><title>Parametrization of  <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m></title>
  <p>
  While we will often use <m>t</m> as the parameter in a parametrized curve <m>\vr(t)</m>,
  there is no need to call it <m>t</m>. Sometimes it is natural to use a different
  name for the parameter. For example, consider the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>.
  It is natural to use the angle <m>\theta</m> in the sketch below to label
  the point <m>\big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)</m> on the circle.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="60%">
  <image source="figs/parCircle"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  That is,
  <me>
  \vr(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
  0\le \theta\lt 2\pi
  </me>
  is a parametrization of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>. Just looking at the figure above, it is clear that, as <m>\theta</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>, <m>\vr(\theta)</m>
  traces out the full circle.
  </p>

  <p>However beware that just knowing that
  <m>\vr(t)</m> lies on a specified curve does not guarantee that, as <m>t</m> varies,
  <m>\vr(t)</m> covers the entire curve. For example, as <m>t</m> runs over the whole
  real line, <m>\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)</m> runs over the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.
  For all <m>t</m>,
  <me>
  \vr(t) = \big(x(t),y(t)\big)
         = a\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)\,,\,
                  \sqrt{1-\frac{4}{\pi^2}\arctan^2(t)}\,\right)
  </me>
  is well-defined and obeys <m>x(t)^2+y(t)^2=a^2</m>. But this <m>\vr(t)</m> does not
  cover the entire circle because <m>y(t)</m> is always positive.
  </p>

  </example>

<example xml:id="eg_paramCircleB"><title>Parametrization of  <m>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=a^2</m></title>
<p>
We can tweak the parametrization of Example <xref ref="eg_paramCircle"/> to get
a parametrization of the circle of radius <m>a</m> that is centred on <m>(h,k)</m>.
One way to do so is to redraw the sketch of Example <xref ref="eg_paramCircle"/>
with the circle translated so that its centre is at <m>(h,k)</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="64%">
<image source="figs/parCirclehk"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
We see from the sketch that 
<me>
\vr(\theta) = \big(h+a\cos\theta\,,\,k+a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
0\le \theta\lt 2\pi
</me>
is a parametrization of the circle <m>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=a^2</m>.
</p>

<p>
A second way to come up with this parametrization is to observe that 
we can turn the trig identity <m>\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t=1</m> into 
the equation <m>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=a^2</m> of the circle by
<ul>
<li>
multiplying the trig identity by <m>a^2</m> to get
<m>(a\cos t)^2 +(a\sin t)^2 =a^2</m> and then
</li><li>
setting <m>\ a\cos t=x-h\ </m> and <m>\ a\sin t=y-k\ </m>, which turns  <m>(a\cos t)^2 +(a\sin t)^2 =a^2</m> into <m>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=a^2</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="eg_paramEllipse"><title>Parametrization of  <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</m> and of <m>x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}</m></title>

<p>
We can build parametrizations of the curves <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</m> 
and <m>x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}</m> from the trig identity <m>\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t=1</m>,
like we did in the second part of the last example.
<ul>
<li>
Setting <m>\ \cos t=\frac{x}{a}\ </m> and <m>\ \sin t=\frac{y}{b}\ </m> turns  
<m>\cos^2 t +\sin^2 t =1</m> into <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</m>.
</li><li>
Setting <m>\ \cos t= \big(\frac{x}{a}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}\ </m> and 
<m>\ \sin t=\big(\frac{y}{a}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}\ </m> turns  
<m>\cos^2 t +\sin^2 t =1</m> into <m>\frac{x^{2/3}}{a^{2/3}}+\frac{y^{2/3}}{a^{2/3}}=1</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
\vr(t) &amp;= \big(a\cos t\,,\,b\sin t\big)\qquad &amp;0\le t\lt 2\pi
</mrow><mrow>
\vr(t) &amp;= \big(a\cos^3 t\,,\,a\sin^3 t\big) &amp;0\le t\lt 2\pi
</mrow>
</md>
give parametrizations of <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</m> 
and <m>x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}</m>, respectively. To see that running <m>t</m> from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m> runs <m>\vr(t)</m> once around the curve, look at the figures below.
</p>
<sidebyside widths="45% 46%" valign="middle">
<image source="figs/parEllipse"/>
<image source="figs/astroid4"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
The curve <m>x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}</m> is called an astroid. From its equation,
we would expect its sketch to look like a deformed circle. But it is probably 
not so obvious that it would have the pointy bits of the right hand figure.
We will not explain here why they arise. The astroid is studied in some 
detail in Example <xref ref="eg_astroid"/>.
In particular, the above sketch is carefully developed there.  
</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="eg_paramMessy"><title>Parametrization of <m>e^y=1+x^2</m></title>
<p>
A very easy method that can often create parametrizations for a curve is to use <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> as a parameter. Because we can solve <m>e^y=1+x^2</m> for <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, namely <m>y=\ln\big(1+x^2\big)</m>, we can use <m>x</m> as 
the parameter simply by setting <m>t=x</m>. This gives the parametrization
<me>
\vr(t) = \big(t\,,\,\ln(1+t^2)\big)\qquad -\infty\lt t\lt \infty
</me>
</p>  
</example>

<example xml:id="eg_paramCircleC"><title>Parametrization of <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>, again</title>
<p>
It is also quite common that one can use either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> to parametrize part of, but not all of, a curve. A simple example is the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>.
For each <m>-a\lt x\lt a</m>, there are two points on the circle with that value of <m>x</m>.
So one cannot use <m>x</m> to parametrize the whole circle.
Similarly, for each <m>-a\lt y\lt a</m>, there are two points on the circle with that value of <m>y</m>. So one cannot use <m>y</m> to parametrize the whole circle. On the other hand
<md alignment="alignat">
<mrow>
\vr(t) &amp;= \big(t\,,\,\sqrt{a^2-t^2}\big)\qquad &amp;-a\lt t\lt a

\vr(t) &amp;= \big(t\,,\,-\sqrt{a^2-t^2}\big)\qquad &amp;-a\lt t\lt a

</md>
provide parametrizations of the top half and bottom half, respectively,
of the circle using <m>x</m> as the parameter, and
<md alignment="alignat">

\vr(t) &amp;= \big(\sqrt{a^2-t^2}\,,\,t\big)\qquad &amp;-a\lt t\lt a

\vr(t) &amp;= \big(-\sqrt{a^2-t^2}\,,\,t\big)\qquad &amp;-a\lt t\lt a
</mrow>
</md>
provide parametrizations of the right half and left half, respectively,
of the circle using <m>y</m> as the parameter.
</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="eg_unparam"><title>Unparametrization of  <m>\vr(t)=(\cos t, 7-t)</m></title>
<p>In this example, we will undo the parametrization <m>\vr(t)=(\cos t, 7-t)</m>
and find the Cartesian equation of the curve in question. We may rewrite the
parametrization as
<md>
<mrow>
x&amp;=\cos t 
</mrow><mrow>
y&amp;=7-t
</mrow>
</md>
Note that we can eliminate the parameter <m>t</m> simply by using the second equation 
to solve for <m>t</m> as a function of <m>y</m>. Namely <m>t=7-y</m>. Substituting this
into the first equation  gives us the Cartesian equation
<me>
x=\cos(7-y)
</me>
</p>
</example>


  <p>Curves often arise as the intersection of two surfaces. For example,
  the intersection of the ellipsoid <m>x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}=1</m>
  with the paraboloid <m>z=x^2+2y^2</m> is the blue curve in the figure
  below.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="60%">
  <image source="figs/stokes6"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  One way to parametrize such curves is to
  choose one of the three coordinates <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> as the parameter,
  and solve the two given equations for the remaining two coordinates,
  as functions of the parameter. Here are two examples.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="eg_paramIntersect">
  <p>
  The set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;-e^{3y}           &amp;&amp;=0
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;-e^{y} +z &amp;&amp;=0
  </mrow>
  </md>
  is a curve. We can choose to use <m>y</m> as the parameter and think of
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;    &amp;&amp;=e^{3y}
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;+z  &amp;&amp;=e^{y}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  as a system of two equations for the two unknowns <m>x</m> and <m>z</m>,
  with <m>y</m> being treated as a given constant, rather than as an unknown.
  We can now solve the first equation for <m>x</m>, substitute the result into
  the second equation, and finally solve for <m>z</m>.
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;    &amp;&amp;=e^{3y}  &amp;&amp;\implies x=e^y
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;+z  &amp;&amp;=e^{y}   &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp;\implies e^{2y}+z=e^y \implies z=e^y-e^{2y}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  So
  <me>
  \vr(y) = \big(e^y\,,\,y\,,\,e^y-e^{2y}\big)
  </me>
  is a parametrization for the given curve.
  </p></example>


  <example xml:id="eg_paramIntersectB">
  <p>
  The previous example was rigged so that it was easy to solve
  for <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> as functions of <m>y</m>. In practice it is not always
  easy, or even possible, to do so. A more realistic example is
  the set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}&amp;=1
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2+2y^2&amp;=z
  </mrow>
  </md>
  which is the blue curve in the figure above.
  Substituting <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> (from the second equation)
  into the first equation gives
  <me>
  -\frac{3}{2}y^2+z+\frac{z^2}{3}=1
  </me>
  or, completing the square,
  <me>
  -\frac{3}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{3}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2 = \frac{7}{4}
  </me>
  If, for example, we are interested in points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve with
  <m>y\ge 0</m>, this can be solved to give <m>y</m> as a function of <m>z</m>.
  <me>
  y=\sqrt{\frac{2}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2-\frac{14}{12}}
  </me>
  Then <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> also gives <m>x</m> as a function of <m>z</m>. If <m>x\ge 0</m>,
  <md>
  <mrow>
  x&amp;=\sqrt{z-\frac{4}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2+\frac{14}{6}}
  </mrow><mrow>
  &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}-\frac{4}{9}z^2-\frac{1}{3}z}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  The other signs of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be gotten by using the appropriate
  square roots. In this example, <m>(x,y,z)</m> is on the curve, i.e. satisfies
  the two original equations, if and only if all of <m>(\pm x,\pm y, z)</m> are also
  on the curve.
