<title>Curves</title>
<introduction>
  <p>We are now going to study vector-valued functions of one real variable.
  That is, we are going to study functions that assign to each real
  number <m>t</m> (typically in some interval) a vector<fn>We are going to use
  boldface letters, like <m>\vr</m>, to designate vectors. When writing by hand,
  it is clearer to use arrows, like <m>\vec r</m>, instead.</fn>
  <m>\vr(t)</m>. For example
  <me>
  \vr(t) = \big( x(t), y(t), z(t)\big)
  </me>
  might be the position of a particle at time <m>t</m>. As <m>t</m> varies,
  <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out a curve.
  </p>

  <p>
  While in some applications <m>t</m> will indeed be <q>time</q>, it does not
  have to be. It can be simply a parameter that is used to label the
  different points on the curve that <m>\vr(t)</m> sweeps out. We then say
  that <m>\vr(t)</m> provides a parameterization of the curve.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="eg_paramCircle">
  <p>
  While we will often use <m>t</m> as the parameter in a parametrized curve <m>\vr(t)</m>,
  there is no need to call it <m>t</m>. Sometimes it is natural to use a different
  name for the parameter. For example, consider the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>.
  It is natural to use the angle <m>\theta</m> in the sketch below to label
  the point <m>\big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)</m> on the circle.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="60%">
  <image source="figs/parCircle"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  That is,
  <me>
  \vr(\theta) = \big(a\cos\theta\,,\,a\sin\theta\big)\qquad
  0\le \theta\le 2\pi
  </me>
  is a parametrization of the circle <m>x^2+y^2=a^2</m>. Just looking at the figure above, it is clear that, as <m>\theta</m> runs from <m>0</m> to <m>2\pi</m>, <m>\vr(\theta)</m>
  traces out the full circle.
  </p>

  <p>However beware that just knowing that
  <m>\vr(t)</m> lies on a specified curve does not guarantee that, as <m>t</m> varies,
  <m>\vr(t)</m> covers the entire curve. For example, as <m>t</m> runs over the whole
  real line, <m>\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)</m> runs over the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.
  For all <m>t</m>,
  <me>
  \vr(t) = \big(x(t),y(t)\big)
         = a\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(t)\,,\,
                  \sqrt{1-\frac{4}{\pi^2}\arctan^2(t)}\,\right)
  </me>
  is well-defined and obeys <m>x(t)^2+y(t)^2=a^2</m>. But this <m>\vr(t)</m> does not
  cover the entire circle because <m>y(t)</m> is always positive.
  </p>

  </example>

  <p>Curves often arise as the intersection of two surfaces. For example,
  the intersection of the ellipsoid <m>x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}=1</m>
  with the paraboloid <m>z=x^2+2y^2</m> is the blue curve in the figure
  below.
  </p>

  <sidebyside width="60%">
  <image source="figs/stokes6"/>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
  One way to parametrize such curves is to
  choose one of the three coordinates <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> as the parameter,
  and solve the two given equations for the remaining two coordinates,
  as functions of the parameter. Here are two examples.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="eg_paramIntersect">
  <p>
  The set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;-e^{3y}           &amp;&amp;=0
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;-e^{y} +z &amp;&amp;=0
  </mrow>
  </md>
  is a curve. We can choose to use <m>y</m> as the parameter and think of
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;    &amp;&amp;=e^{3y}
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;+z  &amp;&amp;=e^{y}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  as a system of two equations for the two unknowns <m>x</m> and <m>z</m>,
  with <m>y</m> being treated as a given constant, rather than as an unknown.
  We can now solve the first equation for <m>x</m>, substitute the result into
  the second equation, and finally solve for <m>z</m>.
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^3&amp;    &amp;&amp;=e^{3y}  &amp;&amp;\implies x=e^y
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2&amp;+z  &amp;&amp;=e^{y}   &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp;\implies e^{2y}+z=e^y \implies z=e^y-e^{2y}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  So
  <me>
  \vr(y) = \big(e^y\,,\,y\,,\,e^y-e^{2y}\big)
  </me>
  is a parametrization for the given curve.
  </p></example>


  <example xml:id="eg_paramIntersectB">
  <p>
  The previous example was rigged so that it was easy to solve
  for <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> as functions of <m>y</m>. In practice it is not always
  easy, or even possible, to do so. A more realistic example is
  the set of all <m>(x,y,z)</m> obeying
  <md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
   x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{3}&amp;=1
  </mrow><mrow>
   x^2+2y^2&amp;=z
  </mrow>
  </md>
  which is the blue curve in the figure above.
  Substituting <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> (from the second equation)
  into the first equation gives
  <me>
  -\frac{3}{2}y^2+z+\frac{z^2}{3}=1
  </me>
  or, completing the square,
  <me>
  -\frac{3}{2}y^2 + \frac{1}{3}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2 = \frac{7}{4}
  </me>
  If, for example, we are interested in points <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve with
  <m>y\ge 0</m>, this can be solved to give <m>y</m> as a function of <m>z</m>.
  <me>
  y=\sqrt{\frac{2}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2-\frac{14}{12}}
  </me>
  Then <m>x^2=z-2y^2</m> also gives <m>x</m> as a function of <m>z</m>. If <m>x\ge 0</m>,
  <md>
  <mrow>
  x&amp;=\sqrt{z-\frac{4}{9}\Big(z+\frac{3}{2}\Big)^2+\frac{14}{6}}
  </mrow><mrow>
  &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}-\frac{4}{9}z^2-\frac{1}{3}z}
  </mrow>
  </md>
  The other signs of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be gotten by using the appropriate
  square roots. In this example, <m>(x,y,z)</m> is on the curve, i.e. satisfies
  the two original equations, if and only if all of <m>(\pm x,\pm y, z)</m> are also
  on the curve.
